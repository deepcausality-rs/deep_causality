DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context-aware
causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overhead and thus is
suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware. DeepCausality is hosted as a sandbox project in the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/).

## ü§î Why DeepCausality?

1) DeepCausality is written in Rust with safety, reliability, and performance in mind.
2) DeepCausality provides recursive causal data structures that concisely express arbitrary complex causal
   structures.
3) DeepCausality enables context awareness across data-like, time-like, space-like, spacetime-like entities stored
   within (multiple) context-hyper-graphs.
4) DeepCausality simplifies modeling of complex tempo-spatial patterns.
5) DeepCausality comes with Causal State Machine (CSM)

## üöÄ Getting Started

In your project folder, just run in a terminal:

```bash
cargo add deep_causality
```

See the [starter example](https://deepcausality.com/getting-started/).

## How to run the example code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality.git

cd deep_causality

make example
```

You can also run the example code from the project root with cargo:

```bash
# make sure you're in the project root folder
cd deep_causality

# CSM (Causal State Machine)
cargo run --release --bin example-csm

# Smoking inference
cargo run --release --bin example-smoking

# Getting started example
cargo run --release --bin starter
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Test 

Cargo works as expected, but in addition to cargo, a makefile exists
that abstracts over several additional tools you for linting and formatting. 
To check and install missing tools, please run the following command:

```bash 
    make install
```

You find the install script in the [script folder.](scripts/install_deps.sh)

The script tests and tries to install all required developer dependencies.
if the automatic install fails, the script will show a link with further installation instructions.

After all dependencies have been installed, the following commands are ready to use.

```bash 
    make build          Builds the code base incrementally (fast) for dev.
    make bench          Runs all benchmarks across all crates.
    make check          Checks the code base for security vulnerabilities.
    make example        Runs the example code.
    make fix            Fixes linting issues as reported by clippy
    make format         Formats call code according to cargo fmt style
    make install        Tests and installs all make script dependencies
    make start          Starts the dev day with updating rust, pulling from git remote, and build the project
    make test           Runs all tests across all crates.
```

The scripts called by each make command are located in the [script folder.](scripts)

##  Bazel

In addition to Cargo and related tools, the entire mono-repo is configured to build and test with Bazel.
Please [install bazelisk ](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk)as it is the only requirement to build the repo with Bazel.  

To query available crate aliases with Bazel, run:

```bash 
    bazel query "kind('alias', //alias/...)"
```

Note, this project uses Bazel aliases extensively for dependencies to ensure if crates relocate, only its alias in [alias/BUILD.bazel](alias/BUILD.bazel) needs to be update to let the build resume. 

To build all targets with Bazel, run:

```bash 
    bazel build //...
```

To build only a specific target and its dependencies, run 

```bash 
    bazel build //alias:deep_causality
```

To test all targets with Bazel, run:

```bash 
    bazel test //...
```

To test only a specific target, run:

```bash 
    bazel test //deep_causality/...
```

To query all available tests to find, for example, all spacetime  tests, run:

```bash 
    bazel query "kind('rust_test', //...)" | grep spacetime
```

To explore all dependencies of a specific crate, run:

```bash 
    bazel query "deps(//alias:dcl_data_structures)"
```

To find all reverse dependencies, i.e. packages that depends on a specific crate, run:

```bash 
    bazel query "rdeps(//..., //alias:dcl_data_structures, 1)"
```

If you were to refactor the dcl_data_structures crate, the rdepds tell you 
upfront were its used and thus helps you to estimate upfront the blast radius of braking changes. 

To query available vendored external dependencies with Bazel, run:

```bash 
    bazel query "kind('rust_library', //thirdparty/...)"
```

Note, these vendored external dependencies are shared across all crates.

To visualize all dependencies of the top level crate deep_causality, run 

```bash 
   bazel query 'deps(//alias:deep_causality, 3) ' --output graph --noimplicit_deps  | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
   
   open graph.png # Works on Mac. 
```
