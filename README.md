# Overview

DeepCausality is a hypergeometric computational causality library that enables fast, context-aware causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. DeepCausality pioneers uniform reasoning across deterministic and probabilistic modalities by implementing the effect propagation process. 

### The Three Pillars of DeepCausality

DeepCausality comprises of three main components:

#### 1. The Causaloid:

*   **What it is:** A self-contained, single unit of causality.
*   **What it does:** It holds a single causal function (`E2 = f(E1)`). It receives an incoming effect, runs its causal function, and emits a new, outgoing effect.

#### 2. The Context:

*   **What it is:** The explicit environment where the Causaloids operate. It holds all the factual data.
*   **What it does:** The Context is a super-flexible data structure (a hypergraph) that holds all the facts about the world: the current time, sensor readings, locations on a map, etc.

#### 3. The Effect Ethos

*   **What it is:** A programmable ethos, to encode and verify operational rules.
*   **What it does:** A Causaloid might reason, "Based on the data, the most logical action is X." But before action X can be taken, the Effect Ethos steps in and checks against a set of rules. It answers the question "**Should this happen?**"

DeepCausality is a framework for building systems that can reason about cause and effect in complex, dynamic environments. It achieves this by treating causality as a process of **effect propagation** between simple, composable **Causaloids** that operate on an explicit, flexible **Context**, all governed by a verifiable safety layer called the **Effect Ethos**. For a more detailed introduction, see the introduction to [DeepCausality document](README_INTRO.md). The DeepCausality project is hosted as a sandbox project in the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/).

## Why DeepCausality?

1) DeepCausality is written in Rust with production-grade safety, reliability, and performance thanks to
   its [UltraGraph backend](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-ultragraph-0-8).
2) DeepCausality provides recursive causal data structures that concisely
   express [arbitrary complex causal structures](https://deepcausality.com/docs/concepts/#structural-conceptualization-of-causation).
3) DeepCausality enables context awareness across complex data stored
   in [multiple contexts](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-multiple-contexts).

4) DeepCausality simplifies modeling of complex tempo-spatial patterns
   and [non-Euclidean geometries](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-non-euclidean).
5) DeepCausality supports [adaptive reasoning](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-adaptive-reasoning).
6) DeepCausality comes with Causal State Machine (CSM).
7) DeepCausality
   supports [programmable ethics via the EffectEthos](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-effect-ethos).

## üöÄ Getting Started

In your project folder, just run in a terminal:

```bash
cargo add deep_causality
```

* [Starter Example](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality/tree/main/examples/starter)
* [More Examples](examples)
* [Tests](deep_causality/tests)

## How to run the example code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality.git

cd deep_causality

make example
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Test

Cargo works as expected, but in addition to cargo, a makefile exists
that abstracts over several additional tools you for linting and formatting.
To check and install missing tools, please run the following command:

```bash 
    make install
```

You find the install script in the [script folder.](build/scripts/install_deps.sh)

The script tests and tries to install all required developer dependencies.
if the automatic install fails, the script will show a link with further installation instructions.

After all dependencies have been installed, the following commands are ready to use.

```bash 
    make build          Builds the code base incrementally (fast) for dev.
    make bench          Runs all benchmarks across all crates.
    make check          Checks the code base for security vulnerabilities.
    make example        Runs the example code.
    make fix            Fixes linting issues as reported by clippy
    make format         Formats call code according to cargo fmt style
    make install        Tests and installs all make script dependencies
    make start          Starts the dev day with updating rust, pulling from git remote, and build the project
    make test           Runs all tests across all crates.
```

The scripts called by each make command are located in the [script folder.](build/scripts)

In addition to Cargo and related tools, the entire mono-repo is configured to build and test with Bazel.
Please [install bazelisk ](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) as it is the only requirement to build the repo with
Bazel. For more details on working with Bazel, see the [Bazel](Bazel.md) document.

If unsure where to start, open an issue and ask. For more significant code contributions,
please run make test and make check locally before opening a PR.
