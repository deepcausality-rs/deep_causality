High performance datastructures used in [DeepCausality](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality).

ArrayGrid is an abstraction over scalars, vectors, and low dimensional matrices similar to a tensor.
In contrast to a tensor, an ArrayGrid is limited to low dimensions (1 to 4), only allowing a scalar,
vector, or matrix type. Still, all of them are represented as a static fixed-size const generic array.
Fixed-sized arrays allow for several compiler optimizations, including a cache-aligned data layout and the removal of
runtime array boundary checks because all structural parameters are known upfront, providing a significant performance
boost over tensors.

The sliding window implementation over-allocates to trade space (memory) for time complexity by delaying the rewind
operation when hitting the end of the underlying data structure.
Specifically, a sliding window of size N can hold, without any array copy, approximately C-1 elements,
where C is the total capacity defined as NxM with N as the window size and M as a multiple.
This crate has two implementations, one over vector and the second over a const generic array. The const generic
implementation is significantly faster than the vector-based version.


## ü§î Why?

1) Zero dependencies.
2) Zero cost abstraction.
3) Zero unsafe by default. Unsafe implementations are available through the `unsafe` feature flag.

# Performance:

## ArrayGrid

**Set value:**

| Dimension | Safe Implementation | Unsafe Implementation | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1D Grid   | 604.71 ps        | 271.38 ps          | 55.1%       |
| 2D Grid   | 581.33 ps        | 417.39 ps          | 28.2%       |
| 3D Grid   | 862.16 ps        | 577.04 ps          | 33.0%       |
| 4D Grid   | 1.137 ns         | 812.62 ps          | 28.5%       |

of the [ArrayGrid document](README_ArrayGrid.md).

**Single Push:**

| Implementation      	| Single Push Time 	| Notes                                                	|
|---------------------	|------------------	|------------------------------------------------------	|
| ArrayStorage        	| ~2.08ns          	| Optimized for continuous access patterns             	|
| VectorStorage       	| ~2.5ns           	| Good for dynamic sizing                              	|
| UnsafeVectorStorage 	| ~2.3ns           	| Better performance than safe vector                  	|
| UnsafeArrayStorage  	| ~1.9ns           	| Best performance for sequential and batch operations 	|


**Sequential Operations:**

| Implementation | Operation Time | Notes                    | 
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------| 
| UnsafeArrayStorage | ~550ps | Best cache utilization   | 
| ArrayStorage | ~605ps | Excellent cache locality | 
| UnsafeVectorStorage | ~750ps | Good for mixed workloads | 
| VectorStorage | ~850ps | Most predictable         |
