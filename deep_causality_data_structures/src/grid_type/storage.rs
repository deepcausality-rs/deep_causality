// Grids in Rust, part 2: const generics
// https://blog.adamchalmers.com/grids-2/#benchmarks-1d-vs-2d-vec-vs-array

// Storage API:
// Single entry type Grid which is generic over its storage and implements for all traits.
// - Only expose a minimal subset to interact with the grid over the storage API
// - Implementing new storage types is a lot easier.
// - The disparity between different representations and what they implement is removed.

/// such as 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D arrays using `PointIndex`.

/// This trait provides a common interface to:
/// - retrieve elements via `get`
/// - modify elements via `set`
/// - introspect the array dimensions if known at compile time.

/// The storage is assumed to be indexed using a `PointIndex`, whose fields
/// `x`, `y`, `z`, and `t` map to dimensions like width, height, depth, and time.
