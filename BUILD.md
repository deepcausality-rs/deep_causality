## 🛠️ Cargo & Make

Cargo works as expected, but in addition to cargo, a makefile exists
that abstracts over several additional tools you may have to install
before all make commands work. To do so, please run the following command:

```bash 
    make install
```

The make install command tests and tries to install all required developer dependencies.
if the automatic install fails, the script will show a link with further installation instructions.

After all dependencies have been installed, the following commands are ready to use.

```bash 
    make build          Builds the code base incrementally (fast) for dev.
    make bench          Runs all benchmarks across all crates.
    make check          Checks the code base for security vulnerabilities.
    make example        Runs the example code.
    make fix            Fixes linting issues as reported by clippy
    make format         Formats call code according to cargo fmt style
    make install        Tests and installs all make script dependencies
    make start          Starts the dev day with updating rust, pulling from git remote, and build the project
    make test           Runs all tests across all crates.
```

The scripts called by each make command are located in the [script folder.](scripts)
