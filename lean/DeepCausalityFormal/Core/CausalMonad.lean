Core — the Causal Monad: the full five-channel carrier, post-P2.

Rust source: `deep_causality_core/src/types/causal_effect_propagation_process/mod.rs`
(`CausalEffectPropagationProcess`) and `src/traits/causal_monad/mod.rs` (`CausalMonad`).

With precondition P2 of the Causal Algebra program enforced
(`openspec/notes/causal-algebra/Formalization.md` §2; change `enforce-w-invariant`), the Rust
carrier encodes value-XOR-error as ONE channel — so the W-invariant (`error ⇒ no value`) holds
by construction and the invalid state the original walking skeleton had to exclude is
unrepresentable.

Post the `separate-control-channel` change the Rust carrier is
`outcome: Result<CausalEffect<Value>, Error>` where
`CausalEffect<V> = Free<CausalCommandWitness, Option<V>>` — i.e. the full transformer stack
`Except E (Free CausalCommand (Maybe V))`. This model is **congruent** with that carrier: it is
its restriction to the `Pure` fragment. `Free CausalCommand (Maybe V)` restricted to `Pure` **is**
`Option V`, so `Except E (Option V)` = the carrier whenever there is no command. Control (a
`RelayTo` jump) is the `Free`'s `Suspend` layer — a SECOND left zero of `bind`, interpreted by the
reasoning engine's `Free::fold` handler (laws from `haft.free_monad.*`) and NOT part of the value
monad-law surface. So the three monad laws below hold over the value fragment exactly as before;
`EPP = CausalMonad ⊕ CausalEffect`.

Layering: the *base* is the lawful monad proved in `Haft/Monad.lean` (`haft.monad.laws`); this file
proves only the causal *extension* of it — the state/context/log/error channels threaded by `bind'`
(a delta over the base, in the haft house style). The value-XOR-error object is `Except E`
(`haft.effect3.monad_laws`), the log channel is the free monoid `Core/EffectLog.lean`
(`core.effect_log.*`), and the control layer is the free monad `haft.free_monad.*`; nothing the base
already establishes is re-proved here.

The model below transcribes the Rust carrier's value fragment channel-for-channel:
  * `outcome : Except E (Option V)` — the value-XOR-error channel; `Option` is the `Maybe` value
    content (`Pure(Some v)` = a value, `Pure(None)` = the `None` effect). The `Free`'s `Suspend`
    control layer is the free-monad extension, orthogonal to these laws.
  * `state : S` — the threaded Markovian state.
  * `ctx : Option C` — the read context threaded by `bind`.
  * `logs : List Λ` — the append-only audit log (Writer over the `List` monoid).

`bind'` transcribes the Rust `bind`: the `Err` arm returns the carrier reassembled verbatim
(the continuation is NOT invoked — raise is a left zero), the `Ok` arm runs the continuation
on (value, state, ctx) and prepends the incoming log. `eta` is the Kleisli unit of the
state-threading monad: it re-emits the received value, state, and context with an empty log
(the arity-5 lift `pure'`, which resets state to a caller-supplied initial value and clears
context, is the unit of the LIFT, not of the Kleisli triple — left identity is stated for it,
right identity for `eta`).

Theorems: left identity, right identity, associativity — all three now hold, right identity
UNCONDITIONALLY (the theorem `bind_right_id` closes the id `core.causal_monad.right_id`,
formerly blocked on P2, and `bind_assoc` closes `core.causal_monad.assoc`). Precondition P1 is now
resolved — control (`RelayTo`) is separated into `CausalCommand` / `CausalEffect` and is a lawful
free monad (`haft.free_monad.*`), no longer a non-lawful variant fused into the value type — so the
value monad here composes cleanly with it (`Except ∘ Free ∘ Maybe`, each layer already proved).

This file is self-contained (no imports) so it typechecks standalone with bare `lean`.

/-- Right identity, UNCONDITIONAL: `bind m eta = m` for EVERY carrier — including errored

    (Formalization.md §2: "under W the right-identity law holds unconditionally").

/-- Associativity: `bind (bind m f) g = bind m (fun v s c => bind (f v s c) g)` — the log
    channel needs associativity of append (the Writer monoid law); every other channel is
    threaded identically on both sides (Moggi 1991).

/-- Raise is a left zero: an errored carrier short-circuits `bind` — the continuation is
    never consulted and error, state, context, and logs survive verbatim. In Rust this is
    the `Err` arm returning `self` reassembled; pinned by the Kani harness
    `causal_monad_short_circuit` and the witness tests.

/-- The carrier is a **lawful monad**: left identity, (unconditional) right identity, and
    associativity hold *together* over one carrier — the `LawfulMonad`-with-effect claim.

    This is the theorem that was blocked on P1. While control (`RelayTo`/`Map`) lived fused into the
    value channel, no single carrier satisfied all three laws at once (a `Map` node broke
    reflexivity / the value law). With P1 resolved (`separate-control-channel`, landed) control is
    the free monad's `Suspend` layer (`haft.free_monad.*`, orthogonal to `bind`) and the value
    carrier is the transformer stack `Except ∘ Free ∘ Maybe` of already-proven monads — so the three
    value laws co-hold. Bundled here from the theorems above (no new obligation, just the joint
    statement that was previously unattainable).
