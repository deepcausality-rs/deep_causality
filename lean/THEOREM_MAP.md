# THEOREM_MAP — Lean ↔ Rust traceability

This is **the bridge**. There is no tool that converts a Lean proof into a Rust test
(`openspec/notes/causal-algebra/Formalization.md` §3). Instead, each **property statement** is
transcribed once per layer and linked here:

- **Lean** *proves* the statement (deductive, unbounded, higher-order).
- **Rust witness** *checks* the same statement independently:
  - `num` / `haft`: a law-test and/or the trait contract itself (the house style).
  - `core`: a **Kani** harness (bounded model checking — first-order, fixed continuations).

The `THEOREM_MAP:` tag in each Lean file and the matching comment in each Rust witness carry the
same **id**. CI (`.github/workflows/formalization.yml`) fails if an id lacks either side.

## Legend

- **Lean**: `proved` = closed, no `sorry`; `sorry` = stated but unproved; `—` = not yet stated.
- **Kani** / **Test**: `✓` present & passing · `partial` · `—` not started · `n/a`.

| `core.causal_effect.relay_termination` | the fuel-bounded relay handler is total: a value answers, answers are fuel-monotone, and a self-relay cycle exhausts (reports) instead of looping — the engine bound is `MAX_RELAY_ROUNDS` (closes tracker #2 Q3's termination item) | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/CausalEffect.lean :: run_pure / run_fuel_monotone / run_self_relay_none` | `deep_causality_core/tests/formalization_lean/causal_effect_tests.rs :: test_relay_termination_fuel_bound` (engine: `deep_causality/tests/…/causality_graph_reasoning_sub_tests.rs :: test_evaluate_subgraph_cuts_a_relay_cycle_with_the_fuel_bound`, stateful twin) | ✓ | — |

| `core.verdict.perm_invariance` | collection aggregation is a BAG operation — the #1 scoped order-invariance theorem: for every `AggregateLogic` mode the aggregate VALUE is invariant under permutation of the member bag (`All`/`Any` commutative-associative meet-/join-folds, `None` from `Any`, `Some(k)` from the permutation-invariant firing count), lifted to the `Coll` node (`coll_perm`); scope = value channel, stateless, all-success path (the #1 ruling — the log channel and stateful path are excluded by statement) | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/VerdictClosure.lean :: aggregate_perm / coll_perm` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/verdict_closure_tests.rs :: test_verdict_perm_invariance` | ✓ | — |
| `core.causaloid.graph_fold_order_invariant` | the topological fold with `∇ ∘ (Λ₁ ⊗ Λ₂)` at reconvergent joins is invariant under every schedule consistent with the causal order: the ∇-fuse is a bag (`fuse_perm`), every consistent schedule computes the schedule-free denotation (`exec_computes_val`), two consistent schedules agree (`schedule_invariant`); preconditions checked at freeze (`freeze_verified`: acyclicity + single-writer + level hook) — closes tracker #2 Q1, engine `∇ = Verdict::join` (Rust behavior change: the loud-fail diamond is now the defined merge, corpus-gated) | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/GraphAlgebra.lean :: fuse_perm / exec_computes_val / schedule_invariant` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/graph_algebra_tests.rs :: test_graph_fold_order_invariant / test_two_writer_diamond_rejected_at_freeze` (corpus: `deep_causality/tests/traits/causable_graph/graph_reasoning/characterization_corpus_tests.rs`) | ✓ | — |
| `core.causaloid.catamorphism_unique` | initiality of the fixpoint, **per fixed carrier**: any interpreter satisfying the three case equations (atom/coll/graph, with the bag equations) of the semantic algebra `(V, elemSem, ∇)` is pointwise equal to `eval`; uniqueness across carriers is neither claimed nor true (#6 correctly scoped; goal B2) | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/Catamorphism.lean :: catamorphism_unique / catamorphism_unique_list` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/catamorphism_tests.rs :: test_catamorphism_unique` | ✓ | — |
| `core.causaloid.encapsulation_flat` | nested fold = flat fold (catamorphism fusion): a wrapped bag contributes exactly its members' fold (wrapper transparency, definitional) and folding a flattened bag equals folding with the back bag as continuation — wrapping a subgraph in a causaloid does not change the semantics | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/Catamorphism.lean :: encapsulation_flat / evalL_append` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/catamorphism_tests.rs :: test_encapsulation_flat` | ✓ | — |

| `core.causaloid.command_input` | F-3: a command (`RelayTo`) on a singleton's INPUT channel yields a specific, named error — never a silent `None`, never a dropped signal, and distinct from the absence-of-evidence error; the input dispatch is total (`command_yields_cmd_err` / `command_never_ok` / `command_err_distinct_from_absent`); matches the real `Causaloid::evaluate` and `evaluate_stateful` singleton paths | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/CommandInput.lean :: command_yields_cmd_err / command_never_ok / command_err_distinct_from_absent` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/command_input_tests.rs :: test_command_input_yields_command_error / test_command_input_yields_command_error_stateful` | ✓ | — |
| `core.context_graph.threading_bind` | the Context hypergraph's parent-set (hyperedge) semantics keyed by identity (`Pa`, the `fired[child][parent]` / `LambdaEdges` `(source,target)` wire surface): hyperedge threading of a node's parents IS the causal monad `bind` (`thread_is_bind`), nested threading = flat (`thread_append`/`evalParents_split`), and encapsulation = flat is bind ASSOCIATIVITY inherited from `core.causal_monad.assoc` (`encapsulation_flat`) — the graph-side `core.causaloid.encapsulation_flat` | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/ContextGraph.lean :: thread_is_bind / thread_append / evalParents_split / encapsulation_flat` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/context_graph_tests.rs :: test_context_parent_set_keyed_by_identity / test_context_encapsulation_is_bind_assoc` | ✓ | — |
| `core.context_graph.acyclicity_separable` | acyclicity is a SEPARABLE, freeze-enforceable parameter over the same parent-set graph: `Acyclic Pa` = a rank certificate (`ultragraph::has_cycle` / `freeze_dag`); a self-parent (cycle) has no certificate and is rejected at freeze (`self_parent_not_acyclic`); the threading/encapsulation apparatus never consults acyclicity, so the cyclic case reuses the same definitions (`apparatus_acyclicity_agnostic`) — enabling the deferred cyclic case (quantum switch / indefinite causal order) | proved | `DeepCausalityFormal/Core/ContextGraph.lean :: Acyclic / self_parent_not_acyclic / acyclic_iff_rank / apparatus_acyclicity_agnostic` | `deep_causality/tests/formalization_lean/context_graph_tests.rs :: test_context_acyclicity_freeze_gate` | ✓ | — |

### Haft layer (`deep_causality_haft`)

All Lean files under `DeepCausalityFormal/Haft/`; the Rust witnesses live in
`deep_causality_haft/tests/formalization_lean/`, which mirrors the Lean tree one-to-one
(`Haft/Functor.lean` ↔ `functor_tests.rs`, `Haft/EffectSystem.lean` ↔
`effect_system_tests.rs`, …; `Haft/Hkt.lean` is a definitional bridge with no theorems and

### Topology layer (`deep_causality_topology`)

Opened by proposal P-3 of the haft deviations note: the `RiemannMap` trait is a bare
signature; the curvature laws live at the concrete `CurvatureTensor`
(`deep_causality_topology/src/types/curvature_tensor/`). Lean files under
`DeepCausalityFormal/Topology/`; Rust witnesses in
`deep_causality_topology/tests/types/curvature_tensor/curvature_tensor_law_tests.rs`.

## Quantum — the partial-trace / Choi foundation and the B1 witness

The `add-quantum-crate` change (`openspec/changes/add-quantum-crate`). The pinned Mathlib v4.15.0 has
no partial trace and no Choi–Jamiołkowski layer, so both are built from first principles on the
pair-indexed matrix model in `DeepCausalityFormal/Quantum/`. The headline is the B1 result: the
unconditional `partial_trace_preservation` is **false** (`partial_trace_nonpreservation`, a witnessed
counterexample), while the *conditional* boundary version holds (`partial_trace_preservation_boundary`).
Rust witnesses in `deep_causality_quantum/tests/formalization_lean/{partial_trace_tests,choi_tests}.rs`.

The **CJ reconstruction isomorphism** `applyChoi (choiOf E) = E` and the QCM theorems
(`quantum.no_influence`, `quantum.markov_commutativity`, `quantum.unitary_factorization`,
`quantum.classical_embedding`, `quantum.cyclic_support`, `quantum.verdict.orthomodular`) are stated
as deferred targets in `openspec/changes/add-quantum-crate`; the crate carries their numerical /
property-test witnesses today. The `/Quantum/` tree is exempt from the CI `sorry` gate while this
foundation is extended.
