/// A `CausalAction` represents an executable action that can be triggered in response to causal conditions.
///
/// In a causal state machine (CSM), actions are paired with causal states. When a causal state's
/// conditions are met (evaluated to true), the associated action is fired.
///
/// # Purpose
/// `CausalAction` encapsulates a function that performs a specific task, such as:
/// - Triggering alerts or alarms
/// - Logging events
/// - Sending notifications
/// - Executing control operations
///
/// # Usage
/// `CausalAction` is typically used in conjunction with `CausalState` in a state-action pair
/// within a causal state machine (CSM). The CSM evaluates states and, when conditions are met,
/// fires the associated actions.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use deep_causality::{ActionError, CausalAction};
///
/// fn get_alert_action() -> CausalAction {
///     let func = || {
///         println!("Alert triggered!");
///         Ok(())
///     };
///     let descr = "Action that triggers an alert";
///     let version = 1;
///
///     CausalAction::new(func, descr, version)
/// }
/// ```
