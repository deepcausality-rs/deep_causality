/// A time model representing **discrete, uniformly spaced ticks** instead of continuous physical time.
///
/// `DiscreteTime` is designed for systems that evolve in **fixed increments**, such as:
/// - Simulation steps
/// - Control loops
/// - State machines
/// - Reinforcement learning environments
/// - Event-driven or digital logic systems
///
/// This model is ideal when:
/// - You don’t need wall-clock time or sub-second resolution
/// - You care only about the **order and progression** of steps
/// - Time is measured in **counted ticks** or iterations
///
/// # Fields
/// - `id`: Unique numeric identifier for the time point
/// - `tick_scale`: Scale of the tick (e.g., `Milliseconds`, `Microseconds`, `Seconds`)
/// - `tick_unit`: The current tick index (`u64`), typically monotonically increasing
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use deep_causality::prelude::{DiscreteTime, Temporal, TimeScale};
///
/// let t0 = DiscreteTime::new(1, TimeScale::Microseconds, 0);
/// let t1 = DiscreteTime::new(2, TimeScale::Microseconds, 1);
///
/// assert!(t0.time_unit() < t1.time_unit());
/// assert_eq!(t0.time_scale(), TimeScale::Microseconds);
/// ```
///
/// # Trait Compatibility
/// - Implements `Identifiable` via `id`
/// - Implements `Temporal<u64>`, so it can be used in any time-aware causal context
///
/// # Use Cases
/// - Agent-based simulations with fixed timesteps
/// - Ticking state machines (e.g., embedded control)
/// - Digital logic simulation
/// - Environments where **temporal resolution** is implicit or constant
///
/// # Note
/// While `tick_unit` is a `u64` and ordered, it does **not** imply any physical duration
/// unless paired with a meaningful `TimeScale`. The interpretation of ticks is context-dependent.
///
/// # See also
/// - `SymbolicTime` for non-numeric symbolic events
/// - `LorentzianTime` or `ProperTime` for physical time
