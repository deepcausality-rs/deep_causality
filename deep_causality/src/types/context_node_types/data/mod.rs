/// wraps a data payload of type `T` and pairs it with a `u64` ID, allowing the
/// data to be uniquely identified and referenced.
///
/// The struct is designed to be lightweight and efficient, deriving `Copy` and `Clone`
/// to allow for easy duplication. The trait bounds on `T` ensure that the contained
/// data is also simple and value-like.

///   type, satisfying the `Default + Copy + Clone + Hash + Eq + PartialEq` bounds.
