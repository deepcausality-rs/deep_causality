    /// - Quaternions are treated as general 4D points (not necessarily normalized).
    /// - You need straight-line (chordal) distance in Euclidean space.
    ///
    /// # Note
    /// If the quaternions represent **unit quaternions** (i.e., orientations), and you wish
    /// to compute the **angular distance** between them, consider overriding this method with:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// let dot = q1.w * q2.w + q1.x * q2.x + q1.y * q2.y + q1.z * q2.z;
    /// let theta = 2.0 * dot.abs().acos(); // Angular distance in radians
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This version reflects the minimal rotation angle between two orientations on the unit hypersphere.
