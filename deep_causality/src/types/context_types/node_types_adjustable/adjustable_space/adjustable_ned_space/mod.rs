/// A local tangent-plane spatial context using the North-East-Down (NED) reference frame.
///
/// `NedSpace` represents a point in a locally linearized coordinate system centered at a reference
/// geodetic location (typically defined by a GPS fix). It is commonly used in aerospace,
/// robotics, and real-time navigation systems to express motion and sensor positions
/// relative to a local Earth-aligned frame.
///
/// This frame uses the following axis definitions:
/// - **North (+N)**: tangential to the Earth's surface, pointing toward the North Pole
/// - **East (+E)**: tangential to the Earth's surface, perpendicular to North, pointing eastward
/// - **Down (+D)**: aligned with gravity, pointing toward the Earth's center (positive downward)
///
/// This results in a **right-handed coordinate system** with the origin at a defined reference point,
/// and the frame fixed to the Earth — making it suitable for integrating IMUs, magnetometers, and
/// other aircraft-attached sensors.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `id`: Unique numeric identifier for this NED spatial context (e.g., sensor ID)
/// - `north`: Position in meters along the northward axis
/// - `east`: Position in meters along the eastward axis
/// - `down`: Position in meters along the downward (gravity-aligned) axis
///
/// # Common Applications
/// - Aircraft position estimation relative to a flight segment origin
/// - Magnetometer placement in local frame for MagNav systems
/// - Inertial Navigation System (INS) drift correction
/// - Real-time sensor fusion in autonomous drones or ground vehicles
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use deep_causality::prelude::*;
///
/// let n1 = NedSpace::new(1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);      // Reference origin
/// let n2 = NedSpace::new(2, 100.0, 50.0, 10.0);  // 100m North, 50m East, 10m below origin
///
/// println!("{}", n2);
///
/// assert_eq!(n2.dimension(), 3);
/// assert_eq!(n1.distance(&n2), (100.0_f64.powi(2) + 50.0_f64.powi(2) + 10.0_f64.powi(2)).sqrt());
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
/// - The "down" axis is **positive in the direction of gravity**. This is a key difference
///   from ENU (East-North-Up) or typical 3D Cartesian conventions.
/// - This struct assumes **flat-Earth approximation** — for global modeling, use [`GeoSpace`] or [`EcefSpace`].
