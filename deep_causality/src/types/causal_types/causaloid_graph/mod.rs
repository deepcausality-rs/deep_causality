/// A specialized graph structure for representing and reasoning about causal relationships.
///
/// `CausaloidGraph` is a wrapper around an `ultragraph` graph, tailored for holding
/// nodes that implement the `Causable` trait. This structure allows for modeling
/// complex, non-linear causal systems where the activation of one cause can influence
/// others in a directed, potentially acyclic, manner.
///
/// The graph uses an adjacency matrix for its underlying storage, which provides
/// fast edge lookups but can be memory-intensive if the graph is sparse and has a
/// large capacity.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T`: The type of the nodes in the graph. It must implement `Causable` to allow
///   for causal reasoning, `PartialEq` for node comparison, `Clone` to manage graph
///   data, and `Display` for explanations. A common `T` is the `Causaloid` struct.
