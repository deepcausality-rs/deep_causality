//! Stateful counterpart to [`crate::MonadicCausable`].
//!
//! `StatefulMonadicCausable<I, O, S, C>` exposes an evaluation method that
//! threads user-defined `State` and `Context` through a causaloid without
//! collapsing them at the trait-method boundary. It coexists with
//! `MonadicCausable<I, O>` — the two traits are independent and a single
//! `Causaloid` value can satisfy both simultaneously, allowing either form of
//! evaluation depending on which method the caller invokes.
//!
//! Use the stateless `MonadicCausable<I, O>` when the causal chain does not
//! need to carry Markovian state or read-only context (`State = ()`,
//! `Context = ()`). Use this stateful trait when state, context, or both must
//! be threaded through the evaluation result.

/// causaloid's stored closure and returns a `PropagatingProcess<O, S, C>` whose
/// `state` and `context` reflect whatever the closure produced — never a

///
/// To author a `Causaloid` intended for stateful evaluation, use the existing
/// [`crate::Causaloid::new_with_context`] constructor with a closure typed as
/// [`crate::StatefulContextualCausalFn`]. **Statefulness is a property of the
/// evaluation call (which trait method is invoked), not of the constructor.**
/// The same `Causaloid` value can be evaluated via
/// [`crate::MonadicCausable::evaluate`] (stateless, drops state) or via
/// [`StatefulMonadicCausable::evaluate_stateful`] (preserves state).
///
/// **Sealed:** implementable only inside `deep_causality` — the causal form set is closed at the
/// three `CausaloidType` shapes (the crate-private `sealed` module; tracker #11a).
