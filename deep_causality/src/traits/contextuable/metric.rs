/// Defines a measurable relationship between two entities within the same space.

/// This trait abstracts over geometric or abstract "distance" computations.

/// Use this trait for types where **numeric comparison** between entities

/// # Notes
/// - Units must match across implementations of `V`
/// - If you're implementing this in a curved or non-Euclidean space,
///   you may need to inject a metric tensor
