//! Distributions for `Float106` (double-double, ~106-bit mantissa).
//!
//! `Float106` is not a single-word IEEE float, so it does not share the bit-construction kernels in
//! `dist_float_common`. Instead a uniform sample is composed from two independent 53-bit `f64`
//! uniforms: a high part in `[0, 1)` and a low part scaled by `2^-53`, giving a value on the full
//! 106-bit grid. The standard-normal draw is Box–Muller over those double-double uniforms, so it
//! carries `Float106` entropy end to end (the `f64` ziggurat path would cap the significand at 53
//! bits).

/// A second independent 53-bit `f64` uniform, shifted into the low half (`× 2^-53`). The product is
/// exact (multiplication by a power of two), so it occupies bits 54..=106 with no rounding.
