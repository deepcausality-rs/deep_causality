# Findings of the first stage


* Total unique Patient_IDs: 40336
* Total number of data records for all patients: 1552210
* Average number of data records per patient: 38
* Total Record Batches: 1516

**The Problem:** You have 40,336 individual mini-time series, each potentially having a unique causal fingerprint. Analyzing each time series in isolation for discovery is computationally prohibitive and prone to overfitting on sparse data.
