use crate::{HKT, Satisfies};

/// The `Foldable` trait abstracts over data structures that can be reduced to a single summary value.
///
/// It provides a `fold` operation (also known as `reduce` or `inject`) that applies a binary function
/// to an accumulator and each element of the structure, from left to right.
///
/// This trait is generic over `F`, which is a Higher-Kinded Type (HKT) witness.
///
/// # Laws (Informal)
///
/// 1.  **Fold right equivalence**: `foldr f z t = foldl (flip f) z (reverse t)` (if `reverse` is defined)
/// 2.  **Fold identity**: `fold f z (pure x) = f z x` (if `pure` is defined)
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// *   `F`: A Higher-Kinded Type (HKT) witness that represents the type constructor
///     (e.g., `OptionWitness`, `ResultWitness<E>`, `VecWitness`).
pub trait Foldable<F: HKT> {
    /// Reduces the elements of the structure to a single value by applying a function.
    ///
    /// This is equivalent to a left-fold (`foldl`) operation. It traverses the structure,
    /// applying the `f` function to an accumulating value and each element.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// *   `fa`: The data structure (`F::Type<A>`) to fold.
    /// *   `init`: The initial value of the accumulator.
    /// *   `f`: A binary function that takes the current accumulator and an element
    ///     from the structure, and returns the new accumulator value.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The final accumulated value after processing all elements.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    ///
    /// *   `A`: The type of the elements within the foldable structure.
    /// *   `B`: The type of the accumulator and the final result.
    /// *   `Func`: The type of the folding function, which must be `FnMut(B, A) -> B`.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use deep_causality_haft::{Foldable, OptionWitness};
    ///
    /// let opt = Some(5);
    /// let sum = OptionWitness::fold(opt, 0, |acc, x| acc + x);
    /// assert_eq!(sum, 5);
    ///
    /// let none_opt: Option<i32> = None;
    /// let sum_none = OptionWitness::fold(none_opt, 0, |acc, x| acc + x);
    /// assert_eq!(sum_none, 0);
    /// ```
