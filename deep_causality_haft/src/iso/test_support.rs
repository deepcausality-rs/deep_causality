//! Property-test helpers for the Tier 3 natural-iso trait family.
//!
//! These helpers are exposed as `pub fn` (not `#[cfg(test)]`-gated) so they
//! are reachable from integration tests under `deep_causality_haft/tests/`.
//! This follows the convention already established by
//! [`crate::utils_tests`] and the Tier 1 / Tier 2 equivalents in
//! `deep_causality_num` (Bazel cannot see `tests/` from `src/`, so
//! coverage-counting test utilities must live in `src/`).
//!
//! - [`assert_natural_iso_round_trip`] — bidirectional round-trip identity.
//!   Takes independent `fa: F::Type<T>` and `ga: G::Type<T>` inputs so that
//!   non-bijective natural transformations cannot slip through (same
//!   design rationale as the Tier 1 / Tier 2 round-trip helpers).
//! - [`assert_natural_iso_naturality`] — naturality with respect to `fmap`:
//!   `to_target(F::fmap(fa, h)) == G::fmap(to_target(fa), h)`.
