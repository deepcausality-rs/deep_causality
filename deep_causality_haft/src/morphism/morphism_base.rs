/// # Category Theory
///
/// `Morphism` is the object/arrow interface of a category: every discovery operator
/// (and, later, every stage of the Causal Arrow) instances it. It is parameterized by a
/// two-argument HKT witness `P: HKT2Unbound`, so the concrete carrier of an arrow is the
/// witness's `Type<A, B>`.
///
/// # Why there is no `compose` here
///
/// General arrow composition `P::Type<A, B>` with `P::Type<B, C>` into `P::Type<A, C>`
/// over *capturing* closures has no single concrete carrier under the repo's
/// `unsafe_code = "forbid"` / no-`dyn` policy (closures are unnameable unique types, and
/// `Box<dyn Fn>` is a forbidden trait object). Identity plus application is the honest,
/// implementable base, and it is enough to host the iteration combinators on
/// [`Endomorphism`](crate::Endomorphism).

/// The canonical function-pointer carrier for [`Morphism`]: an arrow `A → B` is a plain

///
/// Fully static, zero-capture, and free of `dyn`/trait objects. It covers any rule

/// and writes only the graph). Rules that must capture configuration get a dedicated
