//! The `deep_causality_haft` crate provides foundational traits and utilities for
//! implementing Higher-Kinded Types (HKTs) and functional programming patterns
//! (Functor, Applicative, Monad, Foldable) in Rust.
//!
//! This crate is a core component of the `deep_causality` project, enabling
//! the construction of flexible and robust type-encoded effect systems.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! *   **Higher-Kinded Types (HKTs)**: Abstractions over type constructors (e.g., `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`).
//!     This allows writing generic code that works across different container types.
//! *   **Functor**: Defines the `fmap` operation for mapping a function over a type constructor.
//! *   **Applicative**: Extends `Functor` with `pure` (to lift values) and `apply` (to apply
//!     functions within a context).
//! *   **Monad**: Provides the `bind` operation for sequencing computations that produce
//!     effectful values.
//! *   **Foldable**: Defines the `fold` operation for reducing a data structure to a single value.
//! *   **Type-Encoded Effect Systems**: A mechanism to explicitly track and manage side-effects
//!     (like errors, logging, counters) using Rust's type system, ensuring compile-time verification.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! *   `applicative`: Defines the `Applicative` trait.
//! *   `effect`: Defines traits (`Effect3`, `Effect4`, `Effect5`) for partially applying HKTs
//!     to build type-encoded effect systems.
//! *   `extensions`: Provides concrete HKT witness implementations for standard Rust types
//!     like `Option`, `Result`, and `Vec`.
//! *   `foldable`: Defines the `Foldable` trait.
//! *   `functor`: Defines the `Functor` trait.
//! *   `hkt`: Defines the core `HKT` traits (`HKT`, `HKT2`, `HKT3`, `HKT4`, `HKT5`) and `Placeholder`.
//! *   `monad`: Defines the `Monad` trait.
//! *   `monad_effect`: Defines traits (`MonadEffect3`, `MonadEffect4`, `MonadEffect5`)
//!     for monadic operations within type-encoded effect systems.
//! *   `utils_tests`: Internal utilities and test-specific effect types.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is primarily intended for internal use within the `deep_causality` project
//! to build its core abstractions. However, the traits and concepts can be generally applied
//! to other Rust projects requiring advanced functional programming patterns and effect management.
