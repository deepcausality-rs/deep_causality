//! The lazy IO effect: a deferred description of an input/output computation.
//!
//! IO is the workspace's first genuinely side-effecting effect. Every other effect in the family
//! (the `Error`/`Log`/`State` channels of `CausalEffectPropagationProcess`, the `Effect3/4/5`
//! type-encoded effect system) is *pure* — a fixed type parameter threading **data** through a
//! computation, performing no real-world side effect. IO is different: it executes a **real** effect,
//! so its execution must be deferred to the program edge.
//!
//! # Encoding: the Arrow twin, not a witnessed container
//!
//! A lazy, mono-parametric `Io<A>` (the shape the witness [`Monad`](crate::Monad) trait requires —
//! `F::Type<A>` has one hole) cannot store data-dependent continuations without `Box<dyn FnOnce>`,
//! which this workspace forbids. So IO is realized exactly the way the [`Arrow`](crate::Arrow)
//! algebra is realized: an [`IoAction`] trait whose combinators return **new concrete types**
//! ([`IoMap`], [`IoAndThen`], [`IoMapErr`]). Composition is total and monomorphized, with **no
//! `dyn`, no trait objects, no macros**. An `IoAction` is a nullary Kleisli arrow `() ⇝ A` over
//! `Result`.
//!
//! The whole module is `no_std`-safe: it uses only `core` (`Result`, closures, `PhantomData`).
//! Concrete file actions (and the filesystem effect itself) live in `deep_causality_core` behind its
//! `std` feature; this layer is generic over the error type so haft names no concrete error.
//!
//! # Laws
//!
//! `IoAction` is a monad (Kleisli composition over `Result`). With `pure`/`and_then`/`map`:
//!
//! 1. **Left identity:** `pure(a).and_then(f)` ≡ `f(a)`
//! 2. **Right identity:** `m.and_then(pure)` ≡ `m`
//! 3. **Associativity:** `m.and_then(f).and_then(g)` ≡ `m.and_then(|x| f(x).and_then(g))`
//!
//! (Equivalences hold on the value produced by [`IoAction::run`].)
