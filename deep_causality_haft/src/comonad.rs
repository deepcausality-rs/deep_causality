/// The `CoMonad` trait represents a comonadic context, which is the dual of a `Monad`.
///
/// While a `Monad` allows for chaining computations that produce values *within* a context
/// (e.g., `bind` for `M<A>` to `M<B>`), a `CoMonad` focuses on computations that consume
/// values *from* a context and produce new contexts based on observations.
///
/// Think of a `CoMonad` as a context that can be "inspected" or "observed" to yield a value,
/// and then "extended" to produce new contexts by applying a function that observes the original context.
///
/// It provides two primary operations:
/// - `extract`: To get the current value at the "focus" of the context.
/// - `extend`: To create a new comonadic context by applying a function that transforms
///   the original context itself into a value, which then becomes the content of the new context.
///
/// # Intuition & Analogy
///
/// A common analogy is a spreadsheet cell:
/// - `extract` gets the value of the current cell.
/// - `extend` allows you to fill a new spreadsheet with the results of formulas applied
///   to the original spreadsheet. Each cell in the new spreadsheet is derived by observing
///   the context of the old spreadsheet (e.g., the cell itself and its neighbors).
///
/// # Laws (Informal)
///
/// 1.  **Left Identity**: `extend(w, extract) = w`
///     (Extending a context with its own `extract` function should yield the original context).
/// 2.  **Right Identity**: `extract(extend(w, f)) = f(w)`
///     (Extracting from an extended context should be the same as directly applying the function `f` to the context).
/// 3.  **Associativity**: `extend(extend(w, f), g) = extend(w, |w_prime| g(extend(w_prime, f)))`
///     (Extending twice is equivalent to extending once with a composed function).
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// *   `F`: A Higher-Kinded Type (HKT) witness that represents the type constructor
///     (e.g., `BoxWitness`). This `F` must also be a `Functor`.
pub trait CoMonad<F: HKT>: Functor<F> {

    /// without transforming the context itself.

    /// # Arguments
