# deep_causality_fft

Fast Fourier transforms for the DeepCausality stack: plan-based forward and
inverse transforms, generic over `RealField`, with zero external runtime
dependencies. The crate exists to give the DEC-native Navier-Stokes solver a
spectral Poisson solve on periodic lattices (the `add-fft` OpenSpec change),
but the transforms are general-purpose.

## Types

| Type | Transform |
|---|---|
| `FftPlan<R>` | 1-D complex FFT / inverse FFT, any length |
| `RfftPlan<R>` | 1-D real-to-complex (rFFT) / complex-to-real (irFFT), half-spectrum layout |
| `FftPlanNd<R>` | N-dimensional complex FFT by row-column decomposition |
| `RfftPlanNd<R>` | N-dimensional real FFT: rFFT along the last axis, complex along the rest |

`naive_dft` / `naive_idft` are the O(n²) correctness references used by the
test suite; the planner never selects them.

## Algorithm layering

Following the survey in `openspec/notes/fft/fft_state_of_the_art.md`:

1. **Hardcoded small-N kernels** (lengths 1–32): in-place, scratch-free
   planner base cases.
2. **Mixed radix-4/radix-2 Stockham pipeline** (powers of two above 32):
   autosorting — no bit-reversal pass — with regular, unit-stride,
   auto-vectorizable access. This is deliberately *not* flop-minimal
   split-radix; regular access wins on real hardware.
3. **Bluestein's chirp-z fallback** (every other length): the DFT as a
   circular convolution against a chirp, evaluated with the power-of-two
   core, so every length is O(N log N).

The inverse is conjugation reuse of the forward path
(`ifft(x) = conj(fft(conj(x))) / N`) — one kernel serves both directions and
the pair stays consistent by construction.

## Normalization contract

Forward transforms are unnormalized; inverse transforms scale by `1/N`
(`N` = total element count). `ifft(fft(x)) = x` to rounding.

## Plans and scratch

Plans are immutable after construction and hold all precomputed state
(twiddle tables, stage schedules, chirp sequences). Execution borrows a
caller-provided scratch buffer of `plan.scratch_len()` elements and performs
no heap allocation. Twiddles are computed directly per index (no recurrence),
so table accuracy is the scalar's `sin`/`cos` accuracy — which is what makes
the transforms meaningful at `Float106` extended precision, not just `f64`.

```rust
use deep_causality_fft::FftPlan;
use deep_causality_num::Complex;

let plan = FftPlan::<f64>::new(1024)?;
let mut data: Vec<Complex<f64>> = vec![Complex::new(0.0, 0.0); 1024];
let mut scratch = vec![Complex::new(0.0, 0.0); plan.scratch_len()];

plan.execute(&mut data, &mut scratch)?;          // forward, in place
plan.execute_inverse(&mut data, &mut scratch)?;  // back to the input
# Ok::<(), deep_causality_fft::FftError>(())
```

## The `parallel` feature

`--features parallel` enables Rayon fan-out of the independent 1-D batches
inside the N-dimensional plans (the same opt-in pattern as
`deep_causality_topology` and `deep_causality_physics`). Results are
identical to the serial path. A measured granularity threshold keeps small
transforms serial: on Apple Silicon, a 32³ pass ran 2× *slower* under an
unconditional fan-out (short lines, fork-join overhead), while 64³ gains
~1.7×; the threshold sits between the two. Parallel sections allocate
per-thread scratch; the serial path allocates nothing.

## Benchmarks

`cargo bench -p deep_causality_fft` covers 1-D lengths (16–65536 plus a
prime Bluestein size) and the 3-D solver grids. Reference numbers (Apple
Silicon, f64, serial):

| Transform | Time |
|---|---|
| 1-D forward, n = 4096 | ~25 µs |
| 1-D forward, n = 1009 (Bluestein) | ~27 µs |
| 3-D complex forward, 32³ | ~268 µs |
| 3-D real round-trip (rFFT + irFFT), 32³ | ~337 µs |
| 3-D complex forward, 64³ | ~4.8 ms (serial) / ~2.8 ms (`parallel`) |

For scale: the CG-based Leray projection this replaces on periodic lattices
is the dominant cost of the 388 ms (32³) DEC solver step.

## Safety

No `unsafe` — the crate opts into the workspace-wide
`unsafe_code = "forbid"` lint policy.
