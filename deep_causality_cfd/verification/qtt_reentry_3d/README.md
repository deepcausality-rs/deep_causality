# QTT 3-D re-entry forebody sheath — the Stage-6 rank lever (Tier-B)

The 3-D form of the `qtt_blunt_body_2d` rank lever, on the crate's serial `x`-`y`-`z` codec
(`quantize_3d`). The re-entry **forebody sheath** is a curved bow-shock surface standing off the
nose at a constant *physical* radius `R`. In a body-fitted spherical coordinate, with radial axis
`ζ` across the shock, that surface is a step in `ζ` and therefore a function of one axis, so its
bond `χ` is `O(1)` and resolution-independent. Sampled on a Cartesian `2^l × 2^l × 2^l` lattice the
identical physical shell is curved, so `χ` grows with resolution. How fast it grows is the standing
`studies/qtt_rank_3d` question; this harness gates that it grows, not the exponent.

```bash
cargo run --release -p deep_causality_cfd --example qtt_reentry_3d
```

## What it does

A smoothed step at the standoff radius `R = 1.5` is sampled three ways and quantized at tolerance
`1e-8`, and `max_bond()` is read off over a `2^3 → 2^5` ladder:

- **fitted**: the shell as a function of the radial index alone, aligned with one axis;
- **Cartesian**: the same physical shell on a `[−2, 2]³` lattice, curved on the grid;
- **wake**: two off-axis lobes downstream of the body, a multi-feature structure that no single
  fitted coordinate aligns.

## Scope (design D9)

The **forebody** is in scope and gated. The **wake** is out of scope, because a separated, unsteady
wake needs turbulence; its bond is reported only as a datapoint for the standing `qtt_rank_3d`
research question. The dynamic *marched* forebody rank is likewise reported, since there is no 3-D
body-fit metric yet and the marcher runs Cartesian.

## What it verifies (exit nonzero on break)

- **RE-A**: the fitted forebody `χ` stays bounded at 8 or below, and its high-resolution tail is
  flat, with the last refinement adding at most 1.
- **RE-B**: the Cartesian capture `χ` grows with resolution and overtakes the fitted bond by at
  least 2×.

Both gates are **structural**. They bound *rank*, not physical accuracy.

## Measured (f64, 2^3–2^5, <1 s)

| resolution | fitted `χ` (fn ζ) | Cartesian `χ` |
|---|---|---|
| 2^3 | 2 | 10 |
| 2^4 | 4 | 30 |
| 2^5 | 4 | 59 |

Fitted runs 2 to 4 and plateaus. The capture cost runs 10 to 59: a 5.9× rise for a 4× refinement,
so `χ ~ side^1.3`, at or above linear in `side`. A `√side` law would give 3, 4, 6. The `side^0.53`
exponent `studies/qtt_rank_3d` fits comes from a different shock construction over a wider `16³–128³`
ladder; this ladder does not reproduce it. Both gates **PASS**.

## Reported, not gated

- **wake**: `χ = 41` at `2^5`, comparable to the Cartesian capture and un-fittable by construction.
  Out of scope, never gated.
- **dynamic marched forebody**: the Cartesian 3-D marcher grows `χ` to **16** over 6 steps. A 3-D
  body-fit metric plus re-pinning is the open remainder.
