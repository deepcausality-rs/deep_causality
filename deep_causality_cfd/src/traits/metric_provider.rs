//! The `MetricProvider` seam (design D8): a static-dispatch trait that lets the compressible marcher run
//! generically over *any* structured coordinate, so geometry is **data**, not a code path.
//!
//! A marcher written over `M: MetricProvider<R>` consumes only "there is a computational lattice, a way
//! to sample a field onto it, a physical gradient, and a Jacobian volume factor". `CartesianIdentity` is
//! the capture limit (any geometry, high rank); [`BodyFittedCoordinate`](BodyFittedCoordinate) is
//! the fitted limit (this geometry, `O(10)` rank). Body-fittedness becomes a choice of impl, recovering
//! generality at zero asymptotic rank cost — the result the `qtt_blend_metric` study measured.
//!
//! The continuous body-fit blend parameter `λ` (a `BlendedMap` over two providers) is a follow-on: a
//! correct blended metric needs the *forward* Jacobians of both charts, which the present impls do not
//! expose. The blend itself is already validated numerically (`studies/qtt_blend_metric`).
