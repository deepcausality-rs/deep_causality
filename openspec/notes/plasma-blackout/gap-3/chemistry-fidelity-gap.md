# Chemistry-fidelity gap — RAM-C electron-density precision (deferred, bundled with Gap 3)

**Scheduling.** This is a precision upgrade for the Gap-2 ionization physics, **deferred and lumped with
[Gap 3 (the trajectory axis)](gap-three-resolution-1-perturbed-conformal-trajectory.md)**, to be
solved **right after Gap 2 is closed**. It is *not* part of the Tier-A/B surrogate scope; the Stage-4 RAM-C
milestone deliberately gates an order-of-magnitude match. This note records the error anatomy and the levers
so the work is well-scoped when it starts.

---

## The measured gap

The Stage-4 stagnation-line verification (`verification/qtt_ramc_stagline`) lands peak
`n_e = 1.2×10²⁰ m⁻³` against the RAM-C II anchor `1×10¹⁹ m⁻³`: **≈12× (+1.1 decades) high**. A calibrated
production reacting-CFD code (DPLR / LAURA / US3D with finite-rate multi-temperature chemistry) reaches
**~2–3×** on RAM-C peak `n_e`; chemistry-model spread alone is ~2–5×. So 12× is ~4–6× looser than a
production code — the expected order-of-magnitude band for a surrogate, but not production accuracy.

## Where the error actually lives (it is **not** temperature or numerics)

| Quantity | This solver | RAM-C (real) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Post-shock `T₂` | 8044 K | ~7000–8000 K | ~right |
| Ionization fraction `α` | 4.6×10⁻³ | ~3.8×10⁻⁴ | **~12×** |
| → `n_e` | 1.2×10²⁰ | 1×10¹⁹ | ~12× |

`T₂` (and the effective-γ that sets it) is roughly correct, and the IMEX / fitting stages are numerics that
do not touch `n_e`. The entire deviation is an **over-predicted ionization fraction**. The tell: Saha
*equilibrium* at 8000 K is `α≈0.15`; the real flow reaches `α≈3.8×10⁻⁴`, ~400× below equilibrium, because
ionization is rate-limited and never equilibrates. The Tier-A surrogate's single-rate lag only knocks
equilibrium down ~30×. **The lag is too weak, and it ionizes at the wrong (translational) temperature.**

## The levers to reach ~3–4× (all chemistry-model fidelity)

1. **T_ve-controlled ionization (the real Park-2T mechanism, the biggest single lever). — ✅ IMPLEMENTED,
   see [Resolution 2](gap-three-resolution-2-tve-controlled-ionization.md).** The surrogate ionized at the
   translational `T₂`; the physically correct control is the **lagging electron-vibrational temperature
   `T_ve`** (or the geometric-mean `Tₐ = √(T_tr·T_ve)`). In the post-shock zone `T_ve ≪ T_tr`
   (vibrational/electronic modes lag), which suppresses ionization — *that lag is the regime driver*. The
   Tier-A `vibrational_relaxation_kernel` (Millikan–White `τ_vt`, closed-form LER) already computes `T_ve`;
   the change drove the Saha target and the rate off `Tₐ`, not `T_tr`. Exponentially sensitive — **measured
   to move the full ~12× → ~1.1×** on its own (`stagnation_line_blackout_2t`), better than the ~3–4× target.
2. **3-T: separate electron energy (drop the `T_e = T_ve` lumping).** The documented Farbar–Boyd–Martin ~2×
   over-prediction. LER-native: one extra relaxing scalar.
3. **Finite-rate ionization network instead of Saha-target × single associative rate.** RAM-C (~7.6 km/s) is
   *mixed* associative + electron-impact, the latter thresholded, plus recombination. A two-way finite-rate
   network with the right rates tracks the real buildup instead of chasing a too-high Saha target.

`(lever 1, several×) × (lever 2, ~2×)` already brackets the **12× → ~3–4×** target; lever 3 firms it into the
production band. None of these are the QTT marcher stages — they are the reacting `*_rhs` / multi-temperature
kernels in `deep_causality_physics` plus the LER stages.

## Why the marcher stages (5–6) are a prerequisite, not the fix

The 2-D/3-D compressible marcher does not set `n_e` magnitude (chemistry does), but it provides the **real
transported `T_tr` / `T_ve` / species fields** these closures consume — which Tier-A faked with the
recovery-temperature reconstruction. So this chemistry work rides on the marcher, and is correctly scheduled
**after** Gap 2 (the flowfield + Tier-A/B physics) is closed.

## Bundled work item (post-Gap-2)

Solve together with [Gap 3](gap-three-resolution-1-perturbed-conformal-trajectory.md):

- **(Gap 3)** the trajectory/timing axis (2T conformal lift, 6D filter, IERS timing, the regime-switched
  integrator).
- **(this gap)** the n_e chemistry-fidelity upgrade: T_ve-controlled ionization → 3-T electron energy →
  finite-rate ionization network, target **~3–4×** on RAM-C peak `n_e`.
