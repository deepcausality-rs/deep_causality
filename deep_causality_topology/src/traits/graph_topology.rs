//! This module defines the `GraphTopology` trait.

//! The `GraphTopology` trait captures behaviors common to structures that can be

//! This allows for generic algorithms that operate on graph-theoretic properties.

/// A trait for topological structures that exhibit graph-like properties.
///
/// Implementors of this trait represent structures composed of nodes (vertices)
/// and their pairwise connections (edges). This trait extends `BaseTopology`
/// and provides methods for querying graph-specific properties such as
/// the number of nodes and edges, existence of nodes, and retrieving neighbors.

    /// set of vertices.
