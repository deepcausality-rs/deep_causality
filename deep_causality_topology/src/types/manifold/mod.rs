//! Manifold type for smooth geometric structures.
//!
//! `Manifold<K, F>` wraps any `ChainComplex` (simplicial, cubical, or user-defined) and
//! carries an associated field tensor + an optional metric. The metric type is
//! determined by the complex via the plain associated type `K::Metric` — its precision
//! flows from the complex's own type parameters (e.g. `SimplicialComplex<R>` →
//! `ReggeGeometry<R>`, `LatticeComplex<D, R>` → `CubicalReggeGeometry<D, R>`).
//!
//! **The data precision `F` is decoupled from the metric precision.** `F` carries no
//! struct-level trait bound; it may be `RealField` for scalar field data, a multivector
//! from `deep_causality_multivector`, a tensor from `deep_causality_tensor`, a dual
//! number for automatic differentiation, or any other algebraic type that flows through
//! `CausalTensor<F>`. Per-impl-block `F: RealField` bounds are added where numerical
//! operations against `F` actually require them (covariance, simplex volume, curvature
//! contractions, Cayley-Menger, Laplacian, codifferential). This decoupling is the
//! precondition for restoring the full HKT trait surface (`Functor`, `Monad`, `CoMonad`,
//! `Applicative`) on stable Rust — see `design.md` Decision 1 of
//! `generalize-topology-over-realfield` for the rationale.
