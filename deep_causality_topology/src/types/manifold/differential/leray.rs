//! The Leray projection: the divergence-free component of a 1-form via the
//! *half* Hodge decomposition.
//!
//! `P(ω) = ω − dφ` with `Δ₀ φ = δω`, gauge-fixed by mean subtraction — the
//! grade-0 Poisson solve only. The β-step of the full decomposition never
//! runs: the projector costs **one** CG solve per evaluation, and the
//! harmonic-kernel question of `Δ_{k+1}` on periodic lattices does not arise
//! on this path (see `cfd-gap.md` §2 of the `add-dec-solver-foundations`
//! change). On a torus the harmonic component (the mean flow) is
//! divergence-free and is retained unchanged by `ω − dφ`.
//!
//! The grade-0 potential is returned alongside the projected field
//! ([`crate::LerayProjection`]); the opt-in pressure-recovery diagnostic
//! consumes it downstream.
