//! Single-edge Metropolis-Hastings update for `CubicalReggeGeometry<D, R, S>`
//! — Phase R6.4.
//!
//! Operates on `PerEdge` cubical geometries by proposing a Gaussian
//! perturbation to a uniformly-chosen edge length and accepting / rejecting
//! per the Metropolis-Hastings criterion `min(1, exp(−β · ΔS))`.
//!
//! # Locality of ΔS
//!
//! Because the action `S = Σ_h vol(h) · deficit(h)` is bilinear in edge
//! lengths on axis-aligned cubical (the deficit angle is purely
//! combinatorial, see the `gradient` module derivation), the change in
//! action when only `L_e` changes is *exactly*:
//!
//! ```text
//! ΔS = (L_new − L_old) · gradient_at[e]
//! ```
//!
//! No approximation. The single-edge gradient component costs `O(2^D)` to
//! evaluate via the standard `regge_gradient` summation restricted to hinges
//! incident to edge `e`. For implementation simplicity, this R6.4 version
//! computes the full gradient and takes entry `[e]`; a future perf change
//! could maintain an edge-to-hinges inverse map.
//!
//! # Detailed balance
//!
//! Gaussian proposals on edge lengths are symmetric (`q(L'|L) = q(L|L')`),
//! so the Metropolis criterion is the standard `min(1, π(L')/π(L))` with
//! `π ∝ exp(−β S)`. The `NonPositiveLength` rejection (a hard floor at
//! `L > 0`) preserves detailed balance because rejected proposals stay at
//! the current state — design.md Risk 5.
//!
//! # Restricted to Euclidean for now
//!
//! Lorentzian Metropolis is deferred per design.md Decision 7 "Wick rotation
//! deferred subtlety" — the action `S_L = i · S_E` makes
//! `|exp(−β S_L)| = 1` identically, so naive Metropolis-Hastings has no
//! thermalisation. Standard fix is to do MC on the Euclidean action and
//! analytically continue. The Euclidean path implemented here is the
//! primitive that Lorentzian MC would build on.
