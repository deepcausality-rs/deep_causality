//! Curvature, hinge enumeration, deficit angles, and the discrete Regge action for
//! `CubicalReggeGeometry<D, R>` — Phases R2 and R3.
//!
//! ## Dihedral angles on axis-aligned cubical cells
//!
//! Under the project-wide axis-aligned cubical assumption (every edge stored in
//! `EdgeLengths` runs along a coordinate axis, no shear), the two (D−1)-faces of a
//! top D-cube that share any (D−2)-hinge are mutually perpendicular regardless of
//! edge lengths. The dihedral angle is therefore exactly π/2 in every variant:
//! `UnitEdge`, `Uniform`, `PerAxis`, and `PerEdge`.
//!
//! This is a deliberate correction to the original design note
//! `openspec/notes/CubicalReggeCalculus.md` §3.R2, which proposed
//! `arctan2(lengths[j], lengths[i])` for the `PerAxis` case. The proposed formula
//! conflated the dihedral angle between faces with the half-angle of a stretched
//! cube's diagonal; for axis-aligned cubes those are different quantities and only
//! the constant `π/2` is geometrically meaningful as a dihedral.
//!
//! Curvature on a cubical lattice therefore enters only through:
//!
//! 1. **Incidence count of hinges.** Interior hinges in a periodic 2D/3D/4D lattice
//!    have 4 incident top cubes (sum 2π, deficit 0 — flat). Boundary hinges on open
//!    lattices have fewer (e.g. 1 at a 2D corner, sum π/2, deficit 3π/2 — intrinsic
//!    boundary curvature).
//! 2. **Sheared / non-axis-aligned cells**, which the current `EdgeLengths`
//!    representation does not express. A future Gram-matrix-aware extension would
//!    rewrite the dihedral closed forms here.
//!
//! See `openspec/changes/add-cubical-regge-calculus-core/tasks.md` §3 and §4.
