/// normal pointing **from the solid body into the fluid**, a representative **centroid**
/// (a point on the wetted surface, in the same physical coordinates as the lattice nodes),
/// and a [`SourceGeometry`] tag.
/// For a planar cut the area is the exact closed-form cross-section; for a curved surface
/// (cylinder) the area is the high-resolution-quadrature surface measure and the stored
/// normal is the area-representative outward direction over the fragment. The centroid
/// anchors the wall location for the one-sided wall-normal friction diagnostic (the true
/// distance `Δh`, Kirkpatrick 2003). The fragment feeds the Stage-4 immersed-wall BC stage;
/// it is not on the cut-geometry exactness scenario, which gates clipped volume and apertures.
