//! SU(2)×U(1) gauge group - Electroweak unification.
//!
//! The electroweak group combines weak isospin SU(2) and weak hypercharge U(1).
//! It has four generators (three from SU(2) + one from U(1)).

use crate::types::gauge_field::group::GaugeGroup;

/// Electroweak SU(2)×U(1) gauge group marker.
///
/// Represents the unified electroweak gauge symmetry.
///
/// # Properties
///
/// - **Lie algebra dimension**: 4 (3 from SU(2) + 1 from U(1))
/// - **Abelian**: No (SU(2) factor is non-abelian)
/// - **Convention**: West Coast (+---) by default
///
/// # Physics
///
/// The electroweak theory unifies:
/// - Weak isospin SU(2)_L (left-handed fermions)
/// - Weak hypercharge U(1)_Y
///
/// Before symmetry breaking: 4 massless gauge bosons.
/// After Higgs mechanism: photon γ (massless), W+, W-, Z (massive).
///
/// # Weinberg Angle
///
/// The mixing between SU(2) and U(1) is characterized by the Weinberg angle θ_W ≈ 28.7°.
