//! Topology-only invariants extracted from a `HodgeDecomposition<R>`.
//!
//! `TopologicalInvariants<R>` is the pure-topology product of Block B1a of
//! [`openspec/notes/3DCausalFluidDynamics.md`](../../../../openspec/notes/3DCausalFluidDynamics.md):
//! given a manifold and the Hodge–Helmholtz decomposition of some k-form
//! field on it, the invariants are the four Betti numbers `β_0..β_3` of the
//! underlying chain complex plus the three component L2 norms
//! `(‖α‖, ‖β‖, ‖h‖)` of the decomposition.
//!
//! This is exactly the subset of the original B1 design that belongs in the
//! topology crate. The physics quantities the original B1 conflated with
//! topology — vortex detection, helicity sign, integral/Taylor length scales —
//! are field-theoretic invariants of the velocity field, not properties of
//! the discretisation, and live in `deep_causality_physics` (as a separate
//! block in the revised 3D-fluid-dynamics design note).
//!
//! The Betti array is fixed-size `[usize; 4]` and zero-padded for grades
//! beyond the manifold's max dimension. This matches the 3D-fluid pipeline's
//! consumer expectation and keeps the type non-generic over ambient
//! dimension, which simplifies downstream consumers (rolling history,
//! SURD-input assembly) at the cost of carrying two zeros for 2D inputs.
