High performance GridArray and SlidingWindow datastructures used in [DeepCausality](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality).

The sliding window implementation over-allocates to trade space (memory) for time complexity by delaying the rewind
operation when hitting the end of the underlying data structure.
Specifically, a sliding window of size N can hold, without any array copy, approximately C-1 elements,
where C is the total capacity defined as NxM with N as the window size and M as a multiple.
This crate has two implementations, one over vector and the second over a const generic array. The const generic
implementation is significantly faster than the vector-based version.

ArrayGrid is an abstraction over scalars, vectors, and low dimensional matrices similar to a tensor.
In contrast to a tensor, an ArrayGrid is limited to low dimensions (1 to 4), only allowing a scalar,
vector, or matrix type. Still, all of them are represented as a static fixed-size const generic array.
Fixed-sized arrays allow for several compiler optimizations, including a cache-aligned data layout and the removal of
runtime array boundary checks because all structural parameters are known upfront, providing a significant performance
boost over tensors.

## 🤔 Why?

1) Zero dependencies.
2) Zero cost abstraction.
3) Zero unsafe by default. Unsafe implementations are available through the `unsafe` feature flag.

To enable unsafe implementations, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
dcl_data_structures = { version = "0.4.7", features = ["unsafe"] }
```

# Performance:

## Sliding Window

**Single Push:**

| Implementation      	| Single Push Time 	| Notes                                                	|
|---------------------	|------------------	|------------------------------------------------------	|
| ArrayStorage        	| ~2.08ns          	| Optimized for continuous access patterns             	|
| VectorStorage       	| ~2.5ns           	| Good for dynamic sizing                              	|
| UnsafeVectorStorage 	| ~2.3ns           	| Better performance than safe vector                  	|
| UnsafeArrayStorage  	| ~1.9ns           	| Best performance for sequential and batch operations 	|


**Sequential Operations:**

| Implementation | Operation Time | Notes                    | 
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------| 
| UnsafeArrayStorage | ~550ps | Best cache utilization   | 
| ArrayStorage | ~605ps | Excellent cache locality | 
| UnsafeVectorStorage | ~750ps | Good for mixed workloads | 
| VectorStorage | ~850ps | Most predictable         |

of the [SlidingWindow document](README_SlidingWindow.md).
