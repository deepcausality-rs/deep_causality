/// A thread-safe bitmap implementation using atomic operations for concurrent access.
///
/// `BitMap` provides a fixed-size bit array that can be safely accessed and modified
/// from multiple threads. It uses atomic operations to ensure thread safety without
/// requiring explicit locks.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// - Uses an array of `AtomicU64` for storage, where each `AtomicU64` represents 64 bits
/// - Employs bit manipulation for efficient storage and retrieval
/// - All operations are atomic and thread-safe
/// - Memory efficient: bits are packed into 64-bit words
///
/// # Capacity
///
/// The bitmap's capacity is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 64 bits (word size).
/// The actual storage size is calculated as `(capacity + 63) / 64` words.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All operations use `SeqCst` ordering to ensure strict consistency in concurrent scenarios.
