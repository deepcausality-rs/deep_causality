A persistent, immutable, thread-safe tree data structure for the `deep_causality` project.

## Overview

This crate provides `ConstTree<T>`, a foundational Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure designed for efficiency and safety in concurrent environments. It is a persistent data structure, meaning that all modifications are non-destructive and return a new instance of the tree, sharing as much of the underlying data as possible with the original.

This copy-on-write behavior makes it highly efficient to pass trees around and create modified versions without incurring the cost of deep copies.

## Core Features

*   **Persistent & Immutable**: Operations that "modify" the tree are non-destructive. They return a new, modified `ConstTree`, leaving the original unchanged.
*   **Efficient Cloning**: `ConstTree` is built on `std::sync::Arc`. Cloning a tree is a cheap, constant-time operation that simply increments a reference count.
*   **Thread-Safe**: It is `Send` and `Sync` (if `T` is `Send` and `Sync`), allowing it to be safely shared across threads without locks.
*   **Rich API**: Includes a comprehensive API for construction, traversal, searching, and functional mapping.
    *   Multiple iteration strategies (pre-order, post-order, level-order, consuming).
    *   Consuming (`into_map`) and non-consuming (`map`) mapping methods.
    *   Monadic `join` method to flatten a `ConstTree<ConstTree<T>>`.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to create and interact with a `ConstTree`.

```rust
use deep_causality_ast::ConstTree;

fn main() {
    // Create a tree with a root value and some children.
    let leaf1 = ConstTree::new(10);
    let leaf2 = ConstTree::from(20); // `From<T>` is implemented.
    let tree = ConstTree::with_children(5, vec![leaf1, leaf2]);

    // --- Inspection ---
    assert_eq!(*tree.value(), 5);
    assert_eq!(tree.children().len(), 2);
    assert_eq!(tree.depth(), 2);
    assert_eq!(tree.size(), 3);

    // --- Iteration ---
    // The tree can be iterated over in several ways.
    let values: Vec<i32> = tree.iter_pre_order().copied().collect();
    assert_eq!(values, vec![5, 10, 20]);

    // --- Modification ---
    // `add_child` returns a new tree; the original is unchanged.
    let leaf3 = ConstTree::new(30);
    let modified_tree = tree.add_child(leaf3);

    assert_eq!(tree.children().len(), 2); // Original is unaffected.
    assert_eq!(modified_tree.children().len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(*modified_tree.children()[2].value(), 30);

    // --- Mapping ---
    // `map` creates a new tree with a different value type.
    let string_tree = modified_tree.map(&mut |v| format!("val: {}", v));
    assert_eq!(*string_tree.value(), "val: 5");
    assert_eq!(*string_tree.children()[0].value(), "val: 10");

    // `into_map` consumes the tree.
    let owned_string_tree = modified_tree.into_map(|v| format!("owned: {}", v));
    assert_eq!(*owned_string_tree.value(), "owned: 5");
}
```
