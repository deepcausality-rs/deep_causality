/// Represents a **Module** over a `Ring`.
///
/// A module is a generalization of a vector space, where the scalars are
/// elements of a `Ring` `R` rather than being restricted to a `Field`.
///
/// # Mathematical Definition
///
/// A left module `M` over a ring `R` consists of an abelian group `(M, +)` and
/// an operation `R × M → M` (scalar multiplication) such that for all
/// `r, s` in `R` and `x, y` in `M`, the following axioms hold:
///
/// 1.  `r * (x + y) = r*x + r*y`
/// 2.  `(r + s) * x = r*x + s*x`
/// 3.  `(r * s) * x = r * (s * x)`
/// 4.  `1 * x = x` (if `R` is a unital ring)
///
/// ## Structure in this Crate
/// -   The "vectors" (`Self`) form an `AbelianGroup`.
/// -   The "scalars" (`R`) form a `Ring`.
/// -   Scalar multiplication is provided by implementing `Mul<R>` and `MulAssign<R>`.
///
/// ## Examples
/// -   Any `AbelianGroup` `G` is a module over the ring of integers `Z`.
/// -   A vector space is a module where the ring of scalars is a `Field`.
/// -   `Complex<T>` is a module over the `RealField` `T`.

    /// operator for scalar multiplication.

    /// * `scalar`: The scalar value of type `R` to multiply by.

    /// A new element of `Self` representing the scaled result.

    /// for in-place scalar multiplication. This is often more efficient for
    /// large data structures like tensors as it avoids allocation.
