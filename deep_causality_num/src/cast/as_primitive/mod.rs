/// A generic interface for casting between machine scalars with the
/// `as` operator, which admits narrowing and precision loss.
/// Implementers of this trait `AsPrimitive` should behave like a primitive
/// numeric type (e.g. a newtype around another primitive), and the
/// intended conversion must never fail.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use deep_causality_num::AsPrimitive;
/// let three: i32 = (3.14159265f32).as_();
/// assert_eq!(three, 3);
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// **In Rust versions before 1.45.0**, some uses of the `as` operator were not entirely safe.
/// In particular, it was undefined behavior if
/// a truncated floating point value could not fit in the target integer
/// type ([#10184](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)).
///
/// ```ignore
/// # use deep_causality_num::AsPrimitive;
/// let x: u8 = (1.04E+17).as_(); // UB
/// ```
///
