/// A value can be represented by the target type when it lies within
/// the range of scalars supported by the target type.
/// For example, a negative integer cannot be represented by an unsigned
/// integer type, and an `i64` with a very high magnitude might not be
/// convertible to an `i32`.
/// On the other hand, conversions with possible precision loss or truncation
/// are admitted, like an `f32` with a decimal part to an integer type, or
/// even a large `f64` saturating to `f32` infinity.
