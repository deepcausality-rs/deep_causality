## Why?

Custom numerical traits with default implementation for the [DeepCausality project](http://www.deepcausality.com) based on the [rust-num](https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits) crate.

**For projects other than DeepCausality, please use the excellent [rust-num](https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits) crate directly, as this crate is very minimalistic and lacks many common features.**

This crate provides a reduced custom implementation of the `rust-num` main traits with the following properties:

* Zero external dependencies
* Zero unsafe
* Minimal macros (only used for testing)

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
