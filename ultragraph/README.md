## üì£ Goal

`ultragraph` provides a high-performance, ergonomic, and directed graph data structure. It is designed around a
state-machine architecture that offers both a flexible, mutable graph and a blazing-fast, immutable graph, allowing
users to choose the right tool for the right phase of their application.

## üéÅ Features

* **Dual-State Architecture:** A `DynamicGraph` for easy mutations and a `Static` (frozen) `CsmGraph` for extreme read
  performance.
* **Ergonomic Mutations:** Simple `add_node`, `add_edge`, `remove_node`, etc., in the dynamic state.
* **High-Performance Algorithms:** A suite of algorithms (`shortest_path`, `topological_sort`, `has_cycle`) that operate
  on the frozen graph.
* **Efficient Traversals:** Cache-friendly neighbor iteration (`outbound_edges`) on the frozen graph.
* **Full Lifecycle:** Seamlessly `freeze()` a graph for analysis and `unfreeze()` it to resume mutations.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Implementation

`ultragraph`'s power comes from its state-machine design, which separates the concerns of graph *construction* from
graph *analysis*.

### 1. The Dynamic State: `DynamicGraph`

This is the default state, optimized for flexibility and mutations.

* **Underlying Structure:** A standard adjacency list (`Vec<Vec<...>>`).
* **Best For:** Building and modifying your graph topology. Adding, removing, and updating nodes and edges is
  straightforward.
* **Performance:** While flexible, this representation is not ideal for high-speed traversals due to scattered memory
  allocation, which can lead to CPU cache misses.

### 2. The Transition: `freeze()`

This is the bridge between the two states. Calling `g.freeze()` consumes the `DynamicGraph` and transforms it into a
`CsmGraph`. Think of this as a one-time "compilation" step that prepares your graph for high-speed analysis.

### 3. The Static State: `CsmGraph` (Frozen)

This is the high-performance, read-only state.

* **Underlying Structure:** A **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** format. This layout stores all graph edges in a few large,
  contiguous memory blocks, making it extremely cache-friendly for the CPU.
* **Best For:** Running algorithms, performing complex traversals, and any read-heavy workload.
* **Performance:** Because of its exceptional data locality, traversals and algorithms on a `CsmGraph` are orders of
  magnitude faster than on a `DynamicGraph`. All methods on the `GraphAlgorithms` trait require the graph to be in this
  state.

### 4. The Reverse Transition: `unfreeze()`

If you need to make further changes after a period of analysis, `g.unfreeze()` efficiently converts the `CsmGraph` back
into a `DynamicGraph`, allowing the cycle of mutation and analysis to begin again.

## üöÄ Performance

The CSR format of the frozen `CsmGraph` provides exceptional performance for analytical workloads. The one-time cost of
the `freeze()` operation unlocks repeatable, high-speed analysis.

* [Examples](examples)
* [Benchmarks](benches)
* [Tests](tests)

```rust
use ultragraph::*;

#[derive(Default, Debug, Copy, Clone, Hash, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct Data {
    x: u8,
}
impl Display for Data {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.x)
    }
}

pub fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
     let mut g = UltraGraph::with_capacity(10, None);
    assert!(g.is_empty());

    // Add nodes to the graph
    let root_index = g.add_root_node(Data { x: 3 })?;
    let node_a_index = g.add_node(Data { x: 7 })?;
    let node_b_index = g.add_node(Data { x: 9 })?;
    let node_c_index = g.add_node(Data { x: 11 })?;

    // Link nodes together
    g.add_edge(root_index, node_a_index, ())?;
    g.add_edge(node_a_index, node_b_index, ())?;
    g.add_edge(root_index, node_c_index, ())?;

    // Get node a
    let node = g.get_node(node_a_index);
    assert!(node.is_some());

    let data = node?;
    assert_eq!(data.x, 7);
    println!("Retrieved Node A with data: {data:?}");

    println!("Freeze the graph to enable high-performance traversal");
    g.freeze(); // This is the crucial step!

    // neighbors is just a vector of indices
    // so you can iterate over them to get the actual nodes
    println!("Neighbors of root node: ");
    println!("Iterating over neighbors of Node A with a for loop:");
    for neighbor_index in g.outbound_edges(root_index)? {
        // You can use the index to get the node's data
        let neighbor_data = g.get_node(neighbor_index)?;
        println!("- Found neighbor: {neighbor_data} at index {neighbor_index}");
    }

    Ok(())
```
