## üì£ Goal

`ultragraph` provides a high-performance, ergonomic, and directed graph data structure. It is designed around a
state-machine architecture that offers both a flexible, mutable graph and a blazing-fast, immutable graph, allowing
users to choose the right tool for the right phase of their application.

## üéÅ Features

* **Dual-State Architecture:** A `DynamicGraph` for easy mutations and a `Static` (frozen) `CsmGraph` for extreme read
  performance.
* **Ergonomic Mutations:** Simple `add_node`, `add_edge`, `remove_node`, etc., in the dynamic state.
* **High-Performance Algorithms:** A suite of algorithms (`shortest_path`, `topological_sort`, `has_cycle`) that operate
  on the frozen graph.
* **Efficient Traversals:** Cache-friendly neighbor iteration (`outbound_edges`) on the frozen graph.
* **Full Lifecycle:** Seamlessly `freeze()` a graph for analysis and `unfreeze()` it to resume mutations.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Implementation

`ultragraph`'s power comes from its state-machine design, which separates the concerns of graph *construction* from
graph *analysis*.

### 1. The Dynamic State: `DynamicGraph`

This is the default state, optimized for flexibility and mutations.

* **Underlying Structure:** A standard adjacency list (`Vec<Vec<...>>`).
* **Best For:** Building and modifying your graph topology. Adding, removing, and updating nodes and edges is
  straightforward.
* **Performance:** While flexible, this representation is not ideal for high-speed traversals due to scattered memory
  allocation, which can lead to CPU cache misses.

### 2. The Transition: `freeze()`

This is the bridge between the two states. Calling `g.freeze()` consumes the `DynamicGraph` and transforms it into a
`CsmGraph`. Think of this as a one-time "compilation" step that prepares your graph for high-speed analysis.

### 3. The Static State: `CsmGraph` (Frozen)

This is the high-performance, read-only state.

* **Underlying Structure:** A **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** format. This layout stores all graph edges in a few large,
  contiguous memory blocks, making it extremely cache-friendly for the CPU.
* **Best For:** Running algorithms, performing complex traversals, and any read-heavy workload.
* **Performance:** Because of its exceptional data locality, traversals and algorithms on a `CsmGraph` are orders of
  magnitude faster than on a `DynamicGraph`. All methods on the `GraphAlgorithms` trait require the graph to be in this
  state.

### 4. The Reverse Transition: `unfreeze()`

If you need to make further changes after a period of analysis, `g.unfreeze()` efficiently converts the `CsmGraph` back
into a `DynamicGraph`, allowing the cycle of mutation and analysis to begin again.

## Performance Design

The design of `next_graph`'s static analysis structure, `CsmGraph`, is based on the principles for high-performance
sparse graph representation detailed in the paper "NWHy: A Framework for Hypergraph Analytics" (Liu et al.).
Specifically, `next_graph` adopts the paper's foundational model of using two mutually-indexed Compressed Sparse Row (
CSR) structures to enable efficient, `O(degree)` bidirectional traversal‚Äîone for forward (outbound) edges and one for
the transposed graph for backward (inbound) edges.

However, `next_graph` introduces three significant architectural enhancements over this baseline to provide optimal
performance and to support the specific requirements of dynamically evolving systems.

1. **Struct of Arrays (SoA) Memory Layout:** The internal CSR adjacency structures are implemented using a Struct of
   Arrays layout. Instead of a single `Vec<(target, weight)>`, `next_graph` uses two parallel vectors: `Vec<target>` and
   `Vec<weight>`. This memory layout improves data locality for topology-only algorithms (e.g., reachability, cycle
   detection). By iterating exclusively over the `targets` vector, these algorithms avoid loading unused edge weight
   data into the CPU cache, which minimizes memory bandwidth usage and reduces cache pollution.

2. **Adaptive Edge Containment Checks:** The `contains_edge` method employs a hybrid algorithm that adapts to the data's
   shape at runtime. It performs an `O(1)` degree check on the source node and selects the optimal search strategy: a
   cache-friendly linear scan for low-degree nodes (where the number of neighbors is less than a compile-time threshold,
   e.g., 64) and a logarithmically faster binary search for high-degree nodes. This ensures the best possible lookup
   performance across varied graph structures.

3. **Formal Evolutionary Lifecycle:** The most significant architectural addition is a formal two-state model for graph
   evolution. `next_graph` defines two distinct representations: a mutable `DynamicGraph` optimized for efficient `O(1)`
   node and edge additions, and the immutable `CsmGraph` optimized for analysis. The library provides high-performance
   `O(V + E)` `.freeze()` and `.unfreeze()` operations to transition between these states. This two-state model directly
   supports systems that require dynamic structural evolution, such as those modeling emergent causality, by providing a
   controlled mechanism to separate the mutation phase from the immutable analysis phase.

While the NWHypergraph paper provides an excellent blueprint for a high-performance static graph engine, these
modifications extend that foundation into a more flexible, cache-aware, and dynamically adaptable framework
purpose-built for the lifecycle of evolving graph systems.

    // neighbors is just a vector of indices
    // so you can iterate over them to get the actual nodes
    println!("Neighbors of root node: ");
    println!("Iterating over neighbors of Node A with a for loop:");
    for neighbor_index in g.outbound_edges(root_index)? {

        println!("- Found neighbor: {neighbor_data} at index {neighbor_index}");
