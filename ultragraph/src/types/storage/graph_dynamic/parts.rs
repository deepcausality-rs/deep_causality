    /// Creates a `DynamicGraph` directly from its constituent parts.
    ///
    /// This is the most performant way to construct a graph from an existing, validated
    /// dataset, as it bypasses the per-call overhead of methods like `add_edge`.
    ///
    /// # Preconditions
    /// The caller is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the data. Specifically:
    /// - The length of the `edges` vector must be exactly equal to the length of the `nodes` vector.
    /// - Every `usize` target index within the `edges` lists must be a valid index into the `nodes` vector
    ///   (i.e., less than `nodes.len()`).
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// This method will panic in debug builds if `nodes.len() != edges.len()`. It may
    /// cause out-of-bounds panics later if the edge index precondition is violated by the caller.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```rust
    /// use ultragraph::{DynamicGraph, GraphView};
    ///
    /// // Node payloads: Node 1 is "tombstoned" (removed).
    /// let nodes = vec![Some("A"), None, Some("C")];
    ///
    /// // Adjacency lists:
    /// // Node 0 ("A") -> Node 2 ("C") with weight 10.
    /// // Node 1 (None) has no edges.
    /// // Node 2 ("C") -> Node 0 ("A") with weight 5.
    /// let edges = vec![
    ///     vec![(2, 10)],
    ///     vec![],
    ///     vec![(0, 5)],
    /// ];
    ///
    /// // The root node is at index 0.
    /// let root_index = Some(0);
    ///
    /// let parts = (nodes, edges, root_index);
    ///
    /// let graph = DynamicGraph::from_parts(parts);
    ///
    /// assert_eq!(graph.number_nodes(), 2); // Only counts non-tombstoned nodes.
    /// assert_eq!(graph.number_edges(), 2);
    /// assert!(graph.contains_edge(0, 2));
