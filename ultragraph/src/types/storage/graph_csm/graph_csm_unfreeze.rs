/// This implementation provides the logic for the "unfreeze" part of the graph's
/// evolutionary lifecycle. It allows a static, high-performance `CsmGraph` to be
/// converted back into a flexible `DynamicGraph`, readying it for a new phase
/// of mutations and evolution.
///
/// # Infallibility and Design
///
/// A key architectural feature of this method is that it is **infallible**—it does
/// not return a `Result`. This is a deliberate design choice based on the
/// following guarantees:
///
/// 1.  **Guaranteed Input Integrity:** The `unfreeze` method consumes `self`, taking
///     ownership of a `CsmGraph`. Within this library's ecosystem, a `CsmGraph`
///     can only be created by the `.freeze()` operation, which guarantees that its
///     internal state (the CSR structures) is always perfectly consistent and valid.
///
/// 2.  **Deterministic Transformation:** The operation is a deterministic data
///     transformation, not a failable action. It deconstructs the highly structured
///     CSR format into the less constrained `Vec<Vec<...>>` adjacency list. Every
///     valid `CsmGraph` has exactly one corresponding `DynamicGraph` representation.
///
/// There are no logical branches in the `unfreeze` process that could result in a
/// user-handleable error. An out-of-bounds access would indicate a critical bug
/// in the `.freeze()` method's construction logic, which would be a `panic`-worthy
/// programmer error, not a runtime failure.
///
/// This infallible signature provides a strong guarantee to the user: transitioning
/// from an analysis state back to an evolutionary state is always a safe and
/// predictable operation.
