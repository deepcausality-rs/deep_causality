// Also, u32 is used as custom node node index type to bypass the fairly ancient 65k node limit
// coming from the u16 default node index default type in petgraph. The u16 default index limit
// was handled with a wrap-around meaning, after adding 65k nodes to the graph, the index counter
// wrapped back to 0 so that the next insert would start overwriting data in the graph....
//
// u32 has a limit of about 4 billion nodes or, more precisely, 2^31 - 1 (4,294,967,295).
// NodeIndex can be at most u32 because petgraph has no implementation for u64 or u128 index.

// Graph is directed by default because otherwise neighbors would also return all incoming edges

// into many causaloids, it is safe to say that nodes from the context will be retrieved quite
// frequently therefore the direct access from the hashmap should speed things up.
//
// For performance reasons, the AHash hashmap is used instead of the std hashmap.
// AHash is the fastest, DOS resistant hash currently available in Rust...

// set_root_index(). If root index is not set, then get_root_index() will return None.
