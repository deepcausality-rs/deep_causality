# Feature Specification: MaybeUncertain<T> - Explicitly Model Probabilistic Presence of Data

**Feature Branch**: `004-maybeuncertain-is-your`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Introduce a new type to model values that are probabilistically present or absent, to handle real-world sparse data without conflating 'uncertain value' with 'uncertain presence'."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist working with high-dimensional time-series data (e.g., from clinical or aerospace sensors), I want to explicitly model data points that might be missing or absent, so that I can build more robust and verifiable causal models that distinguish between "an uncertain value is present" and "the presence of a value is itself uncertain."

MaybeUncertain<T> can be thought of as a "Probabilistic Maybe" type.
- A standard Option<T> is a binary choice: the value is either there or it's not.
- A MaybeUncertain<T> represents a distribution over Some(T) and None.
Instead of being definitely one or the other, it holds the probability of being in either state.
- The propagation of None in arithmetic (Some(a) + None = None) is also a classic monadic behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a stream of sensor data with intermittent `NULL` values, **When** I model this stream using `MaybeUncertain<T>`, **Then** the `sample()` method on the resulting type returns `None` for the missing points and `Some(value)` for the present points.
2. **Given** a `MaybeUncertain<T>` constructed with a 70% probability of being present (using `from_bernoulli_and_uncertain`), **When** I attempt to convert it to a definite value using `lift_to_uncertain` with a required probability threshold of 60%, **Then** the operation succeeds and returns an `Ok(Uncertain<T>)`.
3. **Given** the same `MaybeUncertain<T>` with a 70% probability of being present, **When** I attempt to convert it using `lift_to_uncertain` with a required probability threshold of 80%, **Then** the operation fails and returns an `Err(UncertainError)`.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when `lift_to_uncertain` is called on a `MaybeUncertain` value that is certainly absent (created with `always_none()`)?** The system MUST always return `Err(UncertainError)`.
- **What happens when `lift_to_uncertain` is called on a `MaybeUncertain` value that is certainly present (created with `from_value(value)`)?** The system MUST always return `Ok(Uncertain<T>)` representing the certain value.
- **How do standard arithmetic operations (e.g., addition) behave when one of the operands is `None`?** The operation MUST propagate the `None`, resulting in `None` (e.g., `Some(A) + None = None`).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST introduce a new public type `MaybeUncertain<T>` within the `deep_causality_uncertain` crate.
- **FR-002**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a `sample()` method that returns an `Option<T>`.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_uncertain(value: Uncertain<T>)` for values that are certainly present, but whose value is uncertain.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_value(value: T)` for values that are certainly present with a certain value (equivalent to `from_uncertain(Uncertain::point(value))`).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::always_none()` for values that are certainly absent.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_bernoulli_and_uncertain(prob_some: f64, present_value_dist: Uncertain<T>)` to model probabilistic presence.
- **FR-007**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method with the signature `lift_to_uncertain(threshold_prob_some: f64, confidence_level: f64, max_samples: usize) -> Result<Uncertain<T>, UncertainError>`.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD implement standard `std::ops` traits (e.g., `Add`, `Sub`) for `MaybeUncertain<T>` such that operations with a `None` value propagate the `None`.
- **FR-009**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method `is_some()` that returns an `Uncertain<bool>` representing the probability of the value being present.
- **FR-010**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method `is_none()` that returns an `Uncertain<bool>` representing the probability of the value being absent.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The introduction of `MaybeUncertain<T>` MUST NOT introduce breaking API changes to the existing `Uncertain<T>` type.
- **NFR-002**: The implementation SHOULD be a zero-cost abstraction where possible, avoiding unnecessary runtime overhead.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MaybeUncertain<T>**: A first-class type representing a value that is probabilistically present or absent. If present, its value is uncertain and represented by the generic type `T`.
- **UncertainError::PresenceError**: A new error variant in `UncertainError` returned when `lift_to_uncertain` is called but the statistical evidence for the value's presence does not meet the required confidence threshold.
