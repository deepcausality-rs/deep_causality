# Implementation Plan: MaybeUncertain<T>

**Branch**: `004-maybeuncertain-is-your` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-maybeuncertain-is-your/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
The feature introduces a new type, `MaybeUncertain<T>`, to explicitly model values that are probabilistically present or absent. This addresses a key limitation of the existing `Uncertain<T>` type, which only models uncertainty of value, not presence. The technical approach is to create a new, self-contained type in the `deep_causality_uncertain` crate, ensuring no breaking changes to the existing API, as detailed in the verified specification.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75
**Primary Dependencies**: `deep_causality_uncertain`, `deep_causality`
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: `cargo test`
**Target Platform**: Platform-agnostic (library)
**Project Type**: Single project (library)
**Performance Goals**: Implementation should be a zero-cost abstraction where possible (NFR-002).
**Constraints**: Must not introduce breaking changes to `Uncertain<T>` (NFR-001).
**Scale/Scope**: Limited to the new `MaybeUncertain<T>` type and its integration.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**: PASS
- Projects: 1 (deep_causality_uncertain)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**: PASS
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: `deep_causality_uncertain` - Provides types for modeling uncertainty.
- CLI per library: N/A for this crate.
- Library docs: Yes, standard Rustdoc will be generated.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: PASS
- TDD will be followed. Tests will be written for each new public function before its implementation, as outlined in the acceptance scenarios.

**Observability**: PASS
- N/A for this feature.

**Versioning**: PASS
- This is a minor, non-breaking feature addition.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1, as this is a library feature.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `contracts/`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from the Functional Requirements in `spec.md`.
- Each constructor and public method for `MaybeUncertain<T>` will have a corresponding task to write tests and then implement the function.
- An integration task will be created to ensure `MaybeUncertain<T>` is properly exported and usable within the `deep_causality` crate.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Test tasks will be prioritized before implementation tasks.
- 1. Implement the type definition and `new` constructor.
- 2. Implement the `always_some` and `always_none` constructors.
- 3. Implement `from_bernoulli_and_uncertain`.
- 4. Implement the `sample` method.
- 5. Implement the `lift_to_uncertain` method.
- 6. Implement operator overloading (optional).
