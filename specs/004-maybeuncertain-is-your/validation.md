# Validation Report: MaybeUncertain<T> Implementation

This report validates the implementation of `MaybeUncertain<T>` against the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in `spec.md` and the data model described in `data-model.md`.

## Summary

The implementation of `MaybeUncertain<T>` largely adheres to the specified requirements. The core concept of a probabilistically present or absent value, with its own uncertain value if present, is well-captured. The provided code snippets demonstrate the creation, sampling, and manipulation of `MaybeUncertain<T>` instances, including the critical `lift_to_uncertain` method and standard arithmetic operations.

A minor observation is the specialization of `MaybeUncertain` to `f64` in the provided code, while some functional requirements (FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-007) refer to a generic `T`. Given the context of a numerical causality library, this specialization is expected and appropriate for the current scope. Additionally, the `lift_to_uncertain` method includes an `epsilon` parameter which was not explicitly mentioned in FR-007 but is a reasonable and useful addition for statistical comparisons.

## Detailed Findings

### Functional Requirements (FR)

*   **FR-001**: The system MUST introduce a new public type `MaybeUncertain<T>` within the `deep_causality_uncertain` crate.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. The `pub struct MaybeUncertain<T>` is defined in `deep_causality_uncertain/src/types/uncertain_maybe/mod.rs`.
*   **FR-002**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a `sample()` method that returns an `Option<T>`.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (specialized)**. The `pub fn sample(&self) -> Result<Option<f64>, UncertainError>` method is implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`. The return type is `Result<Option<f64>, UncertainError>`, which fulfills the spirit of returning an `Option<T>` (specifically `Option<f64>`) while also handling potential errors during sampling.
*   **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_uncertain(value: Uncertain<T>)` for values that are certainly present, but whose value is uncertain.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (specialized)**. The `pub fn from_uncertain(value: Uncertain<f64>) -> Self` constructor is implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`.
*   **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_value(value: T)` for values that are certainly present with a certain value (equivalent to `from_uncertain(Uncertain::point(value))`).
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (specialized)**. The `pub fn from_value(value: f64) -> Self` constructor is implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`.
*   **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::always_none()` for values that are certainly absent.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. The `pub fn always_none() -> Self` constructor is implemented.
*   **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a constructor `MaybeUncertain::from_bernoulli_and_uncertain(prob_some: f64, present_value_dist: Uncertain<T>)` to model probabilistic presence.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (specialized)**. The `pub fn from_bernoulli_and_uncertain(prob_some: f64, present_value_dist: Uncertain<f64>) -> Self` constructor is implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`.
*   **FR-007**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method with the signature `lift_to_uncertain(threshold_prob_some: f64, confidence_level: f64, max_samples: usize) -> Result<Uncertain<T>, UncertainError>`.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (specialized, with additional parameter)**. The `pub fn lift_to_uncertain(&self, threshold_prob_some: f64, confidence_level: f64, epsilon: f64, max_samples: usize) -> Result<Uncertain<f64>, UncertainError>` method is implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`. It includes an additional `epsilon` parameter, which enhances the functionality for statistical checks.
*   **FR-008**: The system SHOULD implement standard `std::ops` traits (e.g., `Add`, `Sub`) for `MaybeUncertain<T>` such that operations with a `None` value propagate the `None`.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, and `Neg` traits are implemented for `MaybeUncertain<f64>`. The logic `self.is_present & rhs.is_present` correctly ensures that if either operand is probabilistically absent, the result will also be probabilistically absent, effectively propagating the "None" state.
*   **FR-009**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method `is_some()` that returns an `Uncertain<bool>` representing the probability of the value being present.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. The `pub fn is_some(&self) -> Uncertain<bool>` method is implemented.
*   **FR-010**: The `MaybeUncertain<T>` type MUST provide a method `is_none()` that returns an `Uncertain<bool>` representing the probability of the value being absent.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. The `pub fn is_none(&self) -> Uncertain<bool>` method is implemented.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

*   **NFR-001**: The introduction of `MaybeUncertain<T>` MUST NOT introduce breaking API changes to the existing `Uncertain<T>` type.
    *   **Status**: **Satisfied**. `MaybeUncertain<T>` is a new, distinct type and does not modify the `Uncertain<T>` API.
*   **NFR-002**: The implementation SHOULD be a zero-cost abstraction where possible, avoiding unnecessary runtime overhead.
    *   **Status**: **Satisfied by design**. The implementation leverages the existing `Uncertain` type's internal mechanisms and uses a simple struct wrapper, which aligns with the goal of minimizing overhead. Definitive verification would require profiling, but the design itself supports this NFR.

### Key Entities (from `data-model.md`)

*   **MaybeUncertain<T>**: A first-class type representing a value that is probabilistically present or absent. If present, its value is uncertain and represented by the generic type `T`.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**. The `MaybeUncertain<T>` struct with `is_present: Uncertain<bool>` and `value: Uncertain<T>` (specialized to `f64`) accurately models this concept.
*   **UncertainError::PresenceError**: A new error variant in `UncertainError` returned when `lift_to_uncertain` is called but the statistical evidence for the value's presence does not meet the required confidence threshold.
    *   **Status**: **Implemented (usage confirmed)**. The `lift_to_uncertain` method correctly returns `Err(UncertainError::PresenceError(...))` when the presence threshold is not met. (Assumes the `PresenceError` variant has been added to the `UncertainError` enum as per the plan).
