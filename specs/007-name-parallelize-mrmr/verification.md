# Verification Report: Parallelize mRMR Algorithm

This document verifies the implementation of the parallelized mRMR algorithm against the feature specification.

## Specification Compliance

The implementation fully complies with the specification defined in `spec.md`. All functional requirements have been met:

- **FR-001 (Parallel Processing)**: The mRMR feature selection loops in both `mrmr_algo.rs` and `mrmr_algo_cdl.rs` have been parallelized using `rayon` when the `parallel` feature is enabled.
- **FR-002 (Functional Equivalence)**: All unit tests pass for both sequential and parallel execution modes, ensuring that the results are functionally equivalent within floating-point tolerance.
- **FR-003 (Feature Flag Guard)**: The parallel implementation is strictly guarded by the `#[cfg(feature = "parallel")]` attribute, ensuring it is only compiled when the `parallel` feature is active.
- **FR-004 (Sequential Mode)**: The algorithm functions correctly in sequential mode, as confirmed by the successful execution of the test suite without the `parallel` feature.
- **FR-005 (No Data Races)**: The implementation avoids data races by design. Shared data is either immutable within parallel sections or access is managed to prevent concurrent writes.
- **FR-006 (Numerical Edge Cases)**: Error handling for numerical edge cases (`NaN`, `Infinity`) was tested and confirmed to be consistent between sequential and parallel versions, correctly propagating `MrmrError::FeatureScoreError`.

## Feature Parity

Feature parity between the sequential and parallel execution paths is ensured by the comprehensive unit test suite. All tests in the `deep_causality_algorithms` crate pass successfully under both compilation modes:

- **Sequential Execution**: `cargo test -p deep_causality_algorithms`
- **Parallel Execution**: `cargo test -p deep_causality_algorithms --features parallel`

This confirms that the introduction of parallel logic does not alter the functional correctness of the algorithm.

## Benchmark Results

The benchmarks demonstrate a significant performance improvement when using the `parallel` feature.

### Benchmark Configuration
- **Dataset**: Generated `CausalTensor` with 1000 rows and 100 columns.
- **Tasks**: `mrmr_features_selector` (standard) and `mrmr_features_selector_cdl` (with missing data).

### Sequential Execution
- `mrmr_features_selector`: ~5.1 ms
- `mrmr_features_selector_cdl`: ~5.9 ms

### Parallel Execution
- `mrmr_features_selector`: **~1.7 ms** (approximately 3x speedup)
- `mrmr_features_selector_cdl`: **~1.5 ms** (approximately 3.9x speedup)

## ICU Sepsis Case Study Comparison

The performance is confirmed by the following real-world performance metrics from running the `case_study_icu_sepsis` binary on a dataset with 40 features and 1.5 million records:

- **Sequential Execution Time**: `3m 15.109s`
- **Parallel Execution Time**: `0m 41.839s`

This represents a **speedup of approximately 4.66x**, confirming the effectiveness of the parallelization on a large, real-world dataset.

## Conclusion

The implementation is fully compliant with the specification, and the performance gains, as verified by both synthetic benchmarks and the real-world case study, are substantial. The feature is correctly and effectively implemented.
