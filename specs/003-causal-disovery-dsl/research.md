# Research for Causal Discovery DSL

## Identified Research Tasks:

### Technical Context Clarification:
- **Research Performance Goals for Causal Discovery DSL**: Investigate typical performance requirements (e.g., processing speed, memory usage) for causal discovery tasks of this nature.
- **Research Constraints for Causal Discovery DSL**: Identify any implicit or explicit constraints (e.g., memory limits, real-time processing needs, data size limitations) that should be considered.

### Project Conventions and Best Practices:
- **Research existing project structure and common patterns for similar features/libraries within the `deep_causality` monorepo**: Analyze existing crates, their structure, testing methodologies, and common utility usage to ensure consistency.
- **Find best practices for Rust in Causal Discovery domain**: General best practices for writing robust, performant, and idiomatic Rust code for scientific computing.
- **Find best practices for `deep_causality_algorithms` in Causal Discovery domain**: How to best integrate and utilize the algorithms from this crate.
- **Find best practices for `deep_causality_tensor` in Causal Discovery domain**: How to efficiently use the tensor data structures for causal discovery.
- **Find best practices for `csv` in Rust**: Efficient and safe handling of CSV file parsing in Rust.
- **Find best practices for `parquet` in Rust**: Efficient and safe handling of Parquet file parsing in Rust.
