# Feature Specification: Causal Discovery DSL

**Feature Branch**: `003-causal-disovery-dsl`  
**Created**: Friday, September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Causal-disovery-dsl Currently, the DeepCausality project does have some algorithms for causal discovery, but lacks a process that simplifies causal discovery. The idea is a build a new crate called: deep_causality_discovery That depends on the following internal crates: deep_causality_algorithms deep_causality_tensor External dependencies may entail: csv - to read csv files parquet - to read parquet files The deep_causality_discovery provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for causal discovery that uses monadic composition to streamline the composition of steps in the discovery process. The high level workflow causal discovery is: 1) Load date from file (CSV or parquet) 2) Run feature selection (using mrmr) 3) Run causal discover (using SURD) 4) Interpret results 5) Format results The main type is called CQD (For Causal Qualities Discovery) and its used to attach multiple steps to be executed in sequence. For example, in pseudo Rust:
```rust
Let path = "data/file.csv"
Let discovery_process = CQD::new()
.start(read_csv(path))
.feat_select(mrmr())
.causal_discovery(surd())
.analyze(analyse_surd_results())
.finalize(format(console_print()))
.build()?;
Let result = discovery_process.run()?;
println(&results);
```
The start step takes a function of type (trait) ProcessDataLoader that loads data and returns a CausalTensor. This would be great to be implemented using the SansIO design pattern. Then feat_select() applies the feature selector that implements trait FeatureSelector passed as parameter to the tensor, and returns the processed tensor to the next step. Likewise, causal_discovery takes a CcausalTensor as input, applies a discovery algorithm that implements the CausalDiscovery trait to the input tensor, and returns The analyze step takes a function of type (trait) ProcessResultAnalyzer, which takes a CausalTensor as as input, analysis the tensor, recommends how to translate the results into a causal structure and retur...

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to perform causal discovery on their data, from loading to formatting results, using a streamlined, composable DSL.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CSV file with data, **When** the user defines a CQD process to load, feature select, causal discover, analyze, and format, **Then** the process runs successfully and prints formatted causal insights.
2. **Given** a Parquet file with data, **When** the user defines a CQD process to load, feature select, causal discover, analyze, and format, **Then** the process runs successfully and prints formatted causal insights.
3. **Given** a CQD process with a `feat_select` step using mRMR, **When** the process is executed, **Then** mRMR is applied to the data before causal discovery.
4. **Given** a CQD process with a `causal_discovery` step using SURD, **When** the process is executed, **Then** SURD is applied to the data.
5. **Given** SURD results, **When** the `analyze` step is executed, **Then** recommendations for converting SURD results to Causaloids are generated.
6. **Given** analyzed results, **When** the `finalize` step is executed with a console printer, **Then** the results are printed to the console in a human-readable format.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when the input file (CSV/Parquet) does not exist or is malformed?** The system will return a `CqdError::ReadDataError` containing a `DataError` variant that specifies the exact nature of the file I/O or parsing issue (e.g., `FileNotFound`, `MalformedCsv`, `InvalidParquetSchema`).
- **How does the system handle cases where feature selection or causal discovery algorithms fail (e.g., insufficient data, numerical instability)?** The system will return a `CqdError::FeatSelectError` or `CqdError::CausalDiscoveryError` respectively, encapsulating specific error variants from `FeatureSelectError` or `CausalDiscoveryError` (e.g., `InsufficientData`, `NumericalInstability`).
- **What happens if the order of steps in the DSL is semantically incorrect (e.g., `feat_select` before `start`)?** The system will prevent invalid step sequences at compile time using the Typestate Pattern.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a `deep_causality_discovery` crate.

- **FR-013**: The system SHOULD optionally provide static verification of the order of steps in the DSL at compile time.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST map aggregate SURD results to `CausaloidGraph` structure (e.g., unique influence to directed edge, synergistic influence to many-to-one connection).
- **FR-015**: The system MUST map state-dependent SURD results to `Causaloid` logic (e.g., conditional effects based on state).
- **FR-016**: The system MUST support modeling multiple causes using `Causaloid Collection` with `Aggregate Logic` (All, Any, Some(k)) based on SURD synergy, unique, or redundant influences.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST define a comprehensive error handling mechanism using a `CqdError` enum, which encapsulates specific errors from each stage of the causal discovery process (data reading, feature selection, causal discovery, result analysis, and finalization). Each nested error enum MUST provide detailed error cases and meaningful display implementations.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST enforce the semantic order of DSL steps at compile time using the Typestate Pattern, where each step returns a new type representing the valid subsequent states of the causal discovery process.

### Heuristics for Translating SURD Results to Causaloid Structures

These heuristics guide the `analyze` step in generating recommendations for building `Causaloid` structures based on the output of the SURD algorithm:

-   **Strong SYNERGY**:
    -   **Rule**: If SURD analysis shows a large synergistic value for a set of source variables (e.g., A, B) influencing a target (Reaction).
    -   **Causaloid Model**: Model with a `Causaloid Collection` containing individual `Causaloid`s for each synergistic source (e.g., `Causaloid(A)`, `Causaloid(B)`). Set the `Aggregate Logic` of the collection to `All` (Conjunction), meaning the collection becomes active only if all constituent `Causaloid`s are active.

-   **Strong UNIQUE or REDUNDANT Influences**:
    -   **Rule**: If SURD analysis shows strong unique contributions from multiple sources (e.g., Virus, Bacteria) influencing a target (Fever).
    -   **Causaloid Model**: Model with a `Causaloid Collection` containing individual `Causaloid`s for each unique/redundant source (e.g., `Causaloid(Virus)`, `Causaloid(Bacteria)`). Set the `Aggregate Logic` of the collection to `Any` (Disjunction), meaning the collection becomes active if at least one constituent `Causaloid` is active.

-   **Complex, Mixed Influences (e.g., multiple synergistic pairs)**:
    -   **Rule**: If SURD analysis shows strong synergistic effects for multiple combinations of sources (e.g., (PS1, PS2), (PS1, PS3), (PS2, PS3)) influencing a target (Server Failure).
    -   **Causaloid Model**: Model with a `Causaloid Collection` with an `Aggregate Logic` of `Some(k)` (Threshold). The value of `k` is determined by the specific rule (e.g., `Some(2)` for "any two of three"). The collection becomes active if at least `k` of the constituent `Causaloid`s are active.
