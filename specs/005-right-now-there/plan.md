# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]


**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature introduces a `DataCleaner` step into the CDL pipeline to explicitly handle missing values (NaN) by converting them to `None` within a `CausalTensor<Option<f64>>`. This change prevents bias from imputation in subsequent steps. The `FeatureSelector` trait and its `MrmrFeatureSelector` implementation will be updated to operate on this new `CausalTensor<Option<f64>>` type, utilizing a pairwise deletion approach for statistical calculations.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75
**Primary Dependencies**: deep_causality_tensor, deep_causality_algorithms
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: cargo test -p deep_causality_discovery
**Target Platform**: WASM
**Project Type**: Library
**Performance Goals**: Not specified for initial implementation
**Constraints**: Not specified for initial implementation
**Scale/Scope**: This feature is focused on improving data handling for missing values within the `deep_causality_discovery` crate.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase
- Crate-specific testing: `cargo test -p crate_name`
- Full repo testing (after major changes to >=3 crates): `make format && make fix && make build && make test`

**Coding Conventions**:
- Field visibility: Public types have private fields with constructors/getters/setters. Private/temporary types can have public fields if scope-limited.
- Static Dispatch: Prefer static dispatch; avoid `dyn`, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch.
- Coding style: Prefer idiomatic zero-cost abstractions and functional style (map, flatmap, filter).
- Safety and security: Avoid `unsafe` in all crates. Avoid macros in lib code (except sparingly for testing). Avoid new external crates unless necessary for testing.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh gemini` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
