is the gauge field AND each theory
1) Correct w.r.t. to its math?
2) Has its math defined in the source file that implements it?
3) Uses the Gauge field

gauge_field
and the HKTs

hkt_gauge_field
of the gauge field to implement its core ops?
4) verified to be correct via meaningful and targeted tests?
5) Production ready?

The key element is that each gauge theory leverages the underlying gauge field as much as possible for the bulk of its operations as to centralize a single source of truth in the gauge field code that, once certified, ensures that subsequene gauge theories are correct in methodology.

Write a comprehensive report, identify gaps and document direct, specific ationable steps to mitigate and close each gap to reach production certification. Write the report to file:
