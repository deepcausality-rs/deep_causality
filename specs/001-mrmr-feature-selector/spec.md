# Feature Specification: Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) Feature Selection

**Feature Branch**: `001-in-deep-causality`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "In deep_causality_algorithms/src/feature_selection/mrmr I want to add a Rust native implentation of @/Users/marvin/RustroverProjects/dcl/deep_causality/ctx/1908.05376v1.pdf which is the Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection algo."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist, I want to use the mRMR algorithm to select the most relevant features from a dataset while minimizing redundancy among the selected features, so that I can improve the performance of my machine learning models.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a dataset with a set of features, **When** I run the mRMR algorithm, **Then** the system returns a ranked list of features based on the mRMR score.
2. **Given** a dataset with known relevant and redundant features, **When** I run the mRMR algorithm, **Then** the relevant features are ranked higher than the redundant features in the output list.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input `CausalTensor` is empty?
- What happens when the input feature set is empty?
- What happens when all features are perfectly correlated (i.e., completely redundant)?
- Non-numeric data within the `CausalTensor` is ignored.
- Missing data points (e.g., NaN) in any column are replaced by the mean of that column.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a Rust native implementation of the Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) feature selection algorithm as specified in the referenced paper (`1908.05376v1.pdf`).
- **FR-002**: The implementation MUST be located within the `deep_causality_algorithms/src/feature_selection/mrmr` directory of the `deep_causality` repository.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST accept a `CausalTensor` from the `deep_causality_data_structures` crate as input.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST output a ranked list of feature identifiers, ordered from most to least important according to the mRMR criteria.
- **FR-005**: The implementation MUST handle cases where the number of requested features is less than or equal to the total number of available features.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST use a custom `MrmrError` enum for all error handling.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST ignore non-numeric data present in the input `CausalTensor`.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST replace any missing data points in a column with the average of that column before processing.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The implementation MUST NOT introduce any new external dependencies.
- **NFR-002**: The implementation MUST NOT use any `unsafe` code blocks.
- **NFR-003**: The implementation MUST NOT use any procedural or declarative macros.
- **NFR-004**: The implementation MUST only use internal crates from the `deep_causality` repository, primarily `deep_causality_data_structures`.
- **NFR-005**: All new code MUST be formatted with `cargo fmt`, pass `clippy` linting, and be successfully checked with `cargo check --all` before integration.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CausalTensor**: Represents the input data for the algorithm, containing samples (rows) and features (columns) with numerical values. This is the primary data structure from `deep_causality_data_structures`.
- **Feature**: A single variable or column within the `CausalTensor` that can be selected.
- **RankedFeatures**: The ordered list of feature identifiers that is the output of the mRMR algorithm.
- **MrmrError**: A custom error enum for handling all error conditions within the mRMR implementation.
